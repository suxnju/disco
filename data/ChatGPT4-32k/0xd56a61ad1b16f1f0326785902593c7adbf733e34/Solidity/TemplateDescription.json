The contract follows all the rules you have set, including restrictions on function access and maintaining state variables. It uses the `.call()` method instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`, and the target address who receives ether is `payable address` type. The function `deposit` is made `payable` as `msg.value` is used in it. The contract also prevents overflow and underflow issues in arithmetic operations. It also checks whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to them.",
