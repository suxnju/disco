It also includes a method for updating the `pushertracker_` value, ensuring that overflow doesn't occur. It includes a method for transferring ether using `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` or `.send()`, and a method for updating the `s_1` mapping. It also includes a method for getting the current block's number, timestamp, and hash.",
