Both functions perform similar logic: they call an external function `daily()` on the participant's address and then call `processPayment()` on the same address with the value returned from `daily()`. The participant's address is updated in the contract's state if the value returned from `processPayment()` is not zero.\n\nThe fallback function is executed if a transaction is sent to this contract that does not match any other function. As per the Solidity documentation: \"A contract can have exactly one unnamed function. This function cannot have arguments, cannot return anything and has to have external visibility.\"",
