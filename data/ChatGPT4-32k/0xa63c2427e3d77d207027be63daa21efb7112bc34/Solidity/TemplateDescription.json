The `withdrawMicroDivs` function checks if the caller is the owner and if so, transfers all of the contract's balance to the owner. The `buyTokensWithProperEvent` function makes a call to the `balanceOf` function of the external contract at the address stored in the `token` variable and if the returned data is not less than 32 bytes, it makes a call to the `buyAndTransfer` function of the same external contract with the provided arguments and the value of the call set to the value sent with the transaction. After this, it makes another call to the `balanceOf` function of the same external contract.",
