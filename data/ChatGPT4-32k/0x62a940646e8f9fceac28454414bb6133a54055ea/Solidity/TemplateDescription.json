These functions are all declared as payable to accept ether. The function `terminate_contract` uses `selfdestruct` to destroy the contract and send its balance to the caller. The `claim_bounty` function updates a mapping `claims` with a future timestamp. The `miller_rabin_test` function makes two delegate calls to different addresses under certain conditions.",
