Thus, it's not included in the Solidity version of the contract.\n\nAlso, the original code seems to have a condition to adjust gas for a function call based on the contract balance. This is not directly possible in Solidity as gas management is mostly handled by EVM, hence not included in the Solidity version of the contract.",
