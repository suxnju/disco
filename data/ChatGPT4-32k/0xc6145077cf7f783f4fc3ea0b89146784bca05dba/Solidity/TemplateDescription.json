				"content": "Sure, here's a simple example of a contract that only allows the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address private owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the contract owner can withdraw\");\n        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n    }\n\n    // This function is used to deposit ethers into the contract.\n    // You can remove this function and deposit ethers to the contract address directly.\n    function deposit() public payable { \n        require(msg.value > 0, \"You need to send some Ether\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, the `constructor` method sets the `owner` variable to the address deploying the contract. The `withdraw` method can only be called by the owner, and it sends all the Ether held by the contract to the owner's address. \n\nThe `deposit` function is for demonstration purposes, you can deposit ethers into the contract by sending ethers to the contract address directly. \n\nPlease note that this is a very simple contract with no complex logic or error handling beyond checking for owner and transfer success, and it doesn't include safemath operations or address checking as per your specifications. In a real-world application, you would want to include more robust error handling and security checks.",
