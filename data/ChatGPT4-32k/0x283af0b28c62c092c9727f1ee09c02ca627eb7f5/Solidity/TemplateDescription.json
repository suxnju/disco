The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to certain functions to the contract's owner, and the `payable` modifier allows functions to receive Ether.\n\nThe `commit`, `setCommitmentAges`, `withdraw`, `renounceOwnership`, `setPriceOracle`, and `transferOwnership` functions work as described.\n\nThe `rentPrice` and `renew` functions check that their first argument is not too long, but the delegate calls and external function calls have been omitted for brevity and because they lack specific information in the problem statement.\n\nThe `available` function checks that its argument is not too long and then makes a delegate call to `s_1_12_32`.",
