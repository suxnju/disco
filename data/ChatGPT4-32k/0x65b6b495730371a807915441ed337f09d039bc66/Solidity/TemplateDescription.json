You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

When v0 is not 0:\n    - When salarysent is not 0:\n      - it calls an external function getHolder of the external contract token with the first argument, and gets the returned value as v2.\n      - For v2, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n        - it calls an external function getState of the external contract token with the first argument, and gets the returned value as v3.\n        - When the call or transfer succeeds, and the payments of the first argument equals to 0, and v3 equals to 1:\n          - it calls an external function gameOverByUser of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v4.\n          - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n            - it calls an external function livingSupply of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v5.\n            - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v5 is not 0:\n              - When (totalpayments+(weireceived/v5)) is not smaller than totalpayments, and (weireceived/v5) does not equal to 0, and the balance of the address of this contract is not smaller than (weireceived/v5):\n                - the state variable totalpayments will be updated to (totalpayments+(weireceived/v5)).\n                - the payments of the first argument will be updated to 1.\n                - it transfers ether valued (weireceived/v5) to caller.\n              - When (totalpayments+(weireceived/v5)) is not smaller than totalpayments, and (weireceived/v5) does not equal to 0, and the balance of the address of this contract is not smaller than (weireceived/v5):\n                - the state variable totalpayments will be updated to (totalpayments+(weireceived/v5)).\n                - the payments of the first argument will be updated to 1.\n                - it transfers ether valued (weireceived/v5) to caller.\n            - When weireceived equals to 0, and v4 is not 0:\n              - the state variable weireceived will be updated to the balance of the address of this contract.\n    - When salarysent is 0:\n      - it calls an external function gameOverByUser of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v4.\n      - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v1 is not 0:\n        - it calls an external function getHolder of the external contract token with the first argument, and gets the returned value as v2.\n        - For v2, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n          - it calls an external function getState of the external contract token with the first argument, and gets the returned value as v3.\n          - When the call or transfer succeeds, and the payments of the first argument equals to 0, and v3 equals to 1:\n            - it calls an external function gameOverByUser of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v4.\n            - it calls an external function livingSupply of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v5.\n            -

When weireceived equals to 0, and v4 is not 0:\n            - the state variable weireceived will be updated to the balance of the address of this contract.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `started` is typed bool,private state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `deuseth` is typed address,public state variable `weireceived` is typed uint256,public state variable `salarysent` is typed bool,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `totalpayments` is typed uint256,public state variable `payments` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
