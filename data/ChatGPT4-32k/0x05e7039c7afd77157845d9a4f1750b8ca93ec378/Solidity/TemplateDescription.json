The `userdeposit` mapping takes in 2 `bytes32` arguments and simply maps the first one to the second one.\n2. The `userWithdraw` function transfers ether from the contract to the user, thus the user address should be of payable type.\n3. The `ownerWithdraw` function also transfers ether from the contract to the owner, thus the owner address should be of payable type. The function checks if the contract has sufficient balance before the transfer.\n4. The `transferOwnership` function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to another address.\n5. The `renounceOwnership` function sets the owner to the zero address, effectively renouncing ownership.\n\nPlease revise as per your specific requirements.",
