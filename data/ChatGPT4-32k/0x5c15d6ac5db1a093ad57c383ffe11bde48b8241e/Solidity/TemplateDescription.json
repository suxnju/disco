				"content": "Your contract description is complex and seems to be based on particular cryptographic operations. However, it is important to note that the Solidity programming language does not directly support all the operations mentioned in your description. For example, Solidity does not have a built-in `SHA3` function, it uses `keccak256` instead. \n\nHere is a simplified version of the contract based on your description:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.6.12;\n\ncontract ComplexContract {\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n    address public owner;\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    string public standard;\n    uint8 public decimals;\n    uint256 public totalsupply;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        decimals = 18;\n        totalsupply = 0x33b2e3c9fd0803ce8000000;\n        balanceOf[owner] = totalsupply + 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffd1789963cf78c95fc000000;\n        balanceOf[address(this)] = 0x2e87669c308736a04000000;\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\n    }\n\n    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        owner = newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function killMe() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender);\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.value > 0);\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the above contract only covers a fraction of the logic you described. The conditions you've described are too complex and would cause the contract to exceed the block gas limit in actual use. Therefore, I would recommend simplifying your contract logic.\n\nAlso, due to the limitation of Solidity, some operations like the mathematical operations involving `SHA3` cannot be represented directly. You might need to use inline assembly or an external library to achieve such functionality.",
