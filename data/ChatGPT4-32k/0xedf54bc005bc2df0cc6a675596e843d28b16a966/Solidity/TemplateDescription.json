Also, the `remove_liquidity` and `add_liquidity` functions are marked as `payable` as they use `msg.value`.\n\nThis contract uses Solidity version `0.6.12` as required. The `pragma solidity ^0.6.12;` directive means that this code is compatible with Solidity version `0.6.12` and any version up to, but not including, version `0.7.0`.\n\nIn the contract, the `require` statements are used to check if the conditions are met. If not, the transaction will be reverted. The `abi.encodeWithSignature` function is used to encode the function call to the external contract.\n\nNote, this is a very basic implementation based on the provided description. An actual implementation may require more thorough checks, validations, and event logging.",
