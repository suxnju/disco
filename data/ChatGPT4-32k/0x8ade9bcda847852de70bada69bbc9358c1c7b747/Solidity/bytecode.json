				"content": "Sorry, but it's not possible to convert the bytecode back into Solidity code with 100% accuracy. The process of compiling Solidity code into bytecode is not reversible because certain information (like variable names, comments, and whitespace) is lost during the compilation process.\n\nHowever, the bytecode can be decompiled into a lower-level language like Yul or LLL, but this would not be as readable or usable as the original Solidity code.\n\nIf you have the original Solidity code that generates this bytecode, it would be much more useful. If you don't have it, it's recommended to write the contract in Solidity again.",
