The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the external contract proxy will be updated to 0x818E6FECD516Ecc3849DAf6845e3EC868087B755.\n- the external contract token will be updated to 0x8316B082621CFedAB95bf4a44a1d4B64a6ffc336.\n- the external contract token1 will be updated to 0x0D8775F648430679A709E98d2b0Cb6250d2887EF.\n- the state variable name will be updated to 0.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0:\n  - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than SHA3(3):\n    - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n  - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than SHA3(3):\n    - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+SHA3(3)):\n      - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n    - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+SHA3(3)):\n      - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+SHA3(3))):\n        - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n      - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+(1+SHA3(3))):\n        - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+(1+SHA3(3)))):\n          - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n        - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+(1+(1+SHA3(3)))):\n          - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+(1+(1+SHA3(3))))):\n            - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n          - When (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is greater than (1+(1+(1+(1+SHA3(3))))), and (SHA3(3)+((31+(name/2))/32)) is not greater than (1+(1+(1+(1+(1+SHA3(3)))))):\n            - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n\nFor the getUniswapSellPrice function.\n- it calls an external function getExchangeRate of the external contract token with the following argument list: 128, 192, 256, 0xde0b6b3a7640000, 3, 0x4554480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 3, 0x4241540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 21, and 0x53454c4c2d554e49535741502d45584348414e47450000000000000000000000.\n\nFor the getKyberBuyPrice function.\n- it calls an external function getExchangeRate of the external contract token with the following argument list: 128, 192, 256, 0xde0b6b3a7640000, 3, 0x4554480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 3, 0x4241540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 18, and 0x4255592d4b594245522d45584348414e47450000000000000000000000000000.\n\nFor the withdrawETHAndTokens function.\n- For owner:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to caller.\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token1 with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When RETURNDATASIZE is not smaller than 32:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token1 with the following argument list: caller, and v0.\n\nFor the payable kyberToUniSwapArb function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transferFrom of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, the address of this contract, and the third argument.\n  - When RETURNDATASIZE is not smaller than 32:\n    - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the first argument with the following argument list: proxy, and 0.\n    - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the first argument with the following argument list: proxy, and the third argument.\n    - it calls an external function tradeWithHint of the external contract proxy with the following argument list: the external contract token1, the third argument, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, the address of this contract, 0x13726987666190aeec798abe93f11d65ee7f340000000000000000, 0, 4, 256, and (name/2).\n    - it calls an external function ethToTokenSwapInput of the second argument with ether valued valued v0 and the following argument list: 1, and current time.\n    - When 31 is not smaller than (name/2), and (name/2) is not 0:\n      - it calls an external function tradeWithHint of the external contract proxy with the following argument list: the external contract token1, the third argument, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, the address of this contract, 0x13726987666190aeec798abe93f11d65ee7f340000000000000000, 0, 4, 256, (name/2), and name, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n        - it calls an external function ethToTokenSwapInput of the second argument with ether valued valued v0 and the following argument list: 1, and current time.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `proxy` is typed address,private state variable `token` is typed address,private state variable `token1` is typed address,private state variable `name` is typed string,private state variable `owner` is typed address.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
