It then has a fallback function that is triggered whenever the contract receives ether, and it takes different actions based on whether the value is zero or not.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic version of your contract and doesn't handle all the edge cases or potential security vulnerabilities. It's strongly recommended to have this code reviewed by a security professional before using it for anything serious.",

The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable totalwithdrewwei will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) equals to 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued 0 to 0x2dB7088799a5594A152c8dCf05976508e4EaA3E4.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the userdividendswei of caller will be updated to the current block's number.\n    - the userdepositedwei of caller will be updated to (the userdepositedwei of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n    - the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to (totaldepositedwei+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n    - For users, except the userdepositedwei of caller equals to 0:\n      - When ((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100) equals to 0:\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to caller.\n        - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n          - the userwithdrewwei of caller will be updated to the userwithdrewwei of caller.\n          - the state variable totalwithdrewwei will be updated to totalwithdrewwei.\n          - the userdividendswei of caller will be updated to the current block's number.\n          - the userdepositedwei of caller will be updated to (the userdepositedwei of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n          - the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to (totaldepositedwei+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - For users, except ((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100) equals to 0:\n        - it transfers ether valued ((((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100)*(the current block's number-the userdividendswei of caller))/5900) to caller.\n        - When the call or transfer fails:\n          - the userwithdrewwei of caller will be updated to (the userwithdrewwei of caller+((((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100)*(the current block's number-the userdividendswei of caller))/5900)).\n          - the state variable totalwithdrewwei will be updated to (totalwithdrewwei+((((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100)*(the current block's number-the userdividendswei of caller))/5900)). Afterthat, \n            - the userdividendswei of caller will be updated to the current block's number.\n            - the userdepositedwei of caller will be updated to (the userdepositedwei of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n          - the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to (totaldepositedwei+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) does not equal to 0:\n  - it transfers ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*15)/100) to 0x2dB7088799a5594A152c8dCf05976508e4EaA3E4.\n  - When the call or transfer fails:\n    - the userdividendswei of caller will be updated to the current block's number.\n    - the userdepositedwei of caller will be updated to (the userdepositedwei of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n    - the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to (totaldepositedwei+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n    - For users, except the userdepositedwei of caller equals to 0:\n      - When ((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100) equals to 0:\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to caller.\n        - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n          - the userwithdrewwei of caller will be updated to the userwithdrewwei of caller.\n          - the state variable totalwithdrewwei will be updated to totalwithdrewwei.\n          - the userdividendswei of caller will be updated to the current block's number.\n          - the userdepositedwei of caller will be updated to (the userdepositedwei of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n          - the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to (totaldepositedwei+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - For users, except ((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100) equals to 0:\n        - it transfers ether valued ((((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100)*(the current block's number-the userdividendswei of caller))/5900) to caller.\n        - When the call or transfer fails:\n          - the userwithdrewwei of caller will be updated to (the userwithdrewwei of caller+((((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100)*(the current block's number-the userdividendswei of caller))/5900)).\n          - the state variable totalwithdrewwei will be updated to (totalwithdrewwei+((((the userdepositedwei of caller*4)/100)*(the current block's number-the userdividendswei of caller))/5900)). Afterthat, \n            - the userdividendswei of caller will be updated to the current block's number.\n            - the userdepositedwei of caller will be updated to (the userdepositedwei of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n          - the state variable totaldepositedwei will be updated to (totaldepositedwei+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `userdepositedwei` is typed mapping,public state variable `userwithdrewwei` is typed mapping,public state variable `userreferralswei` is typed mapping,public state variable `userdividendswei` is typed mapping,public state variable `totaldepositedwei` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalwithdrewwei` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
