A `fallback` function which makes a similar call to `getApp`, then checks the returned address isn't zero. After that, it calls `delegatecall` with the original call data on the returned address.\n\nRemember, delegatecall runs the code of the target contract in the context of the calling contract. If the delegatecall encounters an exception, then it will be propagated to the calling contract. Make sure to handle any potential errors that could be thrown.",
