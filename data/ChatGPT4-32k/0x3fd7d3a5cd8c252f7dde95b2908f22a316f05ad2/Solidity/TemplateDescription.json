Afterthat, \n    - the balances of caller will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the delay_pool_change_block function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is greater than change_block:\n  - the state variable change_block will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the verify_send function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the picops_balances of caller is not smaller than the second argument, and the picops_balances of caller is greater than 0:\n  - the picops_balances of caller will be updated to (the picops_balances of caller-the second argument).\n  - it transfers ether valued the second argument to the first argument.\n\nFor the payable verify_fund function.\n- When is_verified is 0:\n  - the picops_balances of caller will be updated to (the picops_balances of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n\nFor the picops_is_verified function, it has one argument and its type is bool.\n- For 0x2e2e356b67d82d6f4f5d54ffcbcfff4351d2e56c:\n  - the state variable is_verified will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the set_successful_verifier function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For 0x2e2e356b67d82d6f4f5d54ffcbcfff4351d2e56c:\n  - the state variable picops_user will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the perform_withdraw function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When bought_tokens is not 0:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 does not equal to 0, and contract_eth_value is not 0:\n    - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and (((the balances of caller*v0)/contract_eth_value)-(((the balances of caller*v0)/contract_eth_value)/100)), and gets the returned value as v1. Afterthat, \n      - the state variable contract_eth_value will be updated to (contract_eth_value-the balances of caller).\n      - the balances of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - When v1 is not 0:\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: picops_user, and (((the balances of caller*v0)/contract_eth_value)/100).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balances` is typed mapping,public state variable `picops_balances` is typed mapping,public state variable `contract_enabled` is typed bool,public state variable `bought_tokens` is typed bool,public state variable `contract_eth_value` is typed uint256,public state variable `sale` is typed address,public state variable `is_verified` is typed bool,public state variable `picops_user` is typed address,public state variable `h_pwd` is typed bytes32,public state variable `s_pwd` is typed bytes32,public state variable `creator_fee` is typed uint256,public state variable `claim_block` is typed uint256,public state variable `change_block` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
