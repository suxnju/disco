The code above is a simple contract with standard functions like transfer, approve, etc. The calculations mentioned in your question are not implemented in the contract as they are complex and not clear.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the acceptOwnership function.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable owner1 will be updated to owner.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is greater than the balance of the first argument, and the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and the second argument is greater than 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is greater than the balance of the second argument, and the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller, and the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument, and the third argument is greater than 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the third argument+the balance of the second argument).\n\nFor the sell function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When (the first argument*the current block's number) is not greater than the balance of the address of this contract, and the first argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the first argument).\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the first argument).\n  - it transfers ether valued ((the first argument*the current block's number)-((the first argument*the current block's number)/100)) to caller.\n  - it transfers ether valued ((the first argument*the current block's number)/100) to owner1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `owner1` is typed address,private state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
