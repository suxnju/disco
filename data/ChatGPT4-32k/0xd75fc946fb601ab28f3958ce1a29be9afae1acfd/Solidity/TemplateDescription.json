This contract includes the five functions: `approve()`, `decreaseAllowance()`, `increaseAllowance()`, `transfer()`, `transferFrom()`. These functions are used to manage the allowance of a user, increase and decrease the allowance, transfer tokens from one address to another respectively. \n\nNote that the `message()` function has not been implemented because the requirements are ambiguous and appear to be using non-standard cryptographic functions. Also, the logic contains several unexplained variables and operations. Please provide more specific requirements for this function.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the payable decreaseAllowance function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the allowance from caller to the first argument, and the first argument is not 0, and caller is not 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the allowance from caller to the first argument-the second argument).\n\nFor the payable increaseAllowance function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When caller is not 0, and the first argument is not 0, and (the second argument+the allowance from caller to the first argument) is not smaller than the allowance from caller to the first argument:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the allowance from caller to the first argument).\n\nFor the payable message function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: bytes32[], uint256.\n- When SHA3(caller,96,128,(((256*1 and name is 0)-1) and name/2),(symbol and ((symbol and 1 is 0*256)+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)/2)) equals to 0x2dfadbad8e08966063eebbfc760bed02f5228c0d179c9e8937c1095598015282:\n  -

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
