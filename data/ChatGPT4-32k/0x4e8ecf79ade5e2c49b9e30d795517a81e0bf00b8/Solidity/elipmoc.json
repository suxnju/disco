				"content": "Apologies, but it seems there is no decompiled code provided in your request. If you could provide the specific decompiled code, I would be able to help write the contract code better. \n\nHowever, here is a simple example of a Solidity smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SimpleStorage {\n    uint256 private data;\n\n    function set(uint256 x) public {\n        data = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return data;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, we have a private variable `data`. The `set` function allows us to change the value of `data`, and the `get` function allows us to retrieve the current value of `data`.\n\nPlease provide the specific decompiled code and I will be able to help you further.",
