Also, as per your specifications, `.call()` is not used since `.transfer()` is safer for transferring Ether.",

Afterthat, \n    - the s_6 from the pidxaddr_ of caller to 2 will be updated to 0.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `s_0` is typed uint256,public state variable `airdroppot_` is typed uint256,public state variable `airdroptracker_` is typed uint256,public state variable `timeleft` is typed uint256,public state variable `pidxaddr_` is typed mapping,public state variable `pidxname_` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_6` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_7` is typed mapping,public state variable `plyrnames_` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_9` is typed mapping,public state variable `rndtmeth_` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_11` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_12` is typed mapping,public state variable `activated_` is typed bool,private state variable `s_66448226337682112469901396875338497574368918010328814248214166510316316219960` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_66448226337682112469901396875338497574368918010328814248214166510316316219962` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
