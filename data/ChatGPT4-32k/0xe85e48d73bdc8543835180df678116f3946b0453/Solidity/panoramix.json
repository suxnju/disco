The `fallback` function is a function that is executed when a contract is called but no other function matches the given function identifier, or if no data is supplied. \n\nThe fallback function must be marked `external` and it must have `payable` keyword if your contract needs to receive Ether together with a call. \n\nFallback functions cannot have arguments, cannot return anything and must have external visibility. It's also important to note that a contract can only have one fallback function.",
