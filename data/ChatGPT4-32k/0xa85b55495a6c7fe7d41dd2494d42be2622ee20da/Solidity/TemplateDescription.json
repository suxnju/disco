The payable fallback function provides the desired logic, including the differing behavior before and after the deadline. The `safeWithdrawal` function is also implemented, transferring ether and tokens as specified. Note that this contract assumes that the `tokenreward` contract has `balanceOf` and `transfer` functions that adhere to the ERC20 standard.",
