This contract is not safe from re-entrancy attacks. You should add a mutex or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to avoid re-entrancy vulnerabilities. \n2. It is always a good idea to check for overflows and underflows in your arithmetic operations. Consider using a library like SafeMath to handle this automatically. \n3. You should handle error cases where a transfer fails. This contract uses the .call.value() method and checks the return value to detect failed transfers. \n4. Always be careful when handling ether in smart contracts. Consider getting a security audit for any contract that will hold a significant amount of value.",
