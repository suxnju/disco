It also includes functions for getting block details, executing transactions, encoding data, getting Keccak and SHA-256 hashes of data, and recovering the signer of a signature. Note that safety checks are included to prevent sending Ether to the zero address and to ensure the contract has enough balance before sending Ether.",
