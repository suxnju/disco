				"content": "Apologies, but the provided decompiled code you've given seems to be incomplete or incorrectly formatted, which makes it difficult to write a corresponding Solidity contract. However, I'll provide a basic example of a Solidity contract that implements a fallback function with some restrictions:\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.6;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    // Fallback function\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // Ensure the call data is less than 4 bytes\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Data length is too high\");\n\n        // Ensure there is no data\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Data should not be present\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract has a fallback function that is payable (meaning it can accept ETH). The requires statements enforce two conditions on the transaction call data:\n\n1. The length of the call data must be less than 4 bytes.\n2. The length of the call data must be 0.\n\nThese conditions should not both be true at the same time. This code is for illustrative purposes based on the provided decompiled code and may not function as expected. For a real-world contract, you'd want to be clear on the requirements and ensure they make sense and can be met under certain conditions.",
