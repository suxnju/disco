It uses the `fallback` function to receive Ether and update the caller's balance and the total supply. It includes `approve`, `acceptOwnership`, `transferOwnership`, `withdrawTo`, `withdraw`, `transferFrom`, `transfer`, and `deposit` functions. It uses `require` to check conditions and `transfer` to send Ether. It uses `.call()` for external calls and `abi.encodeWithSignature` for function calls to other contracts.",
