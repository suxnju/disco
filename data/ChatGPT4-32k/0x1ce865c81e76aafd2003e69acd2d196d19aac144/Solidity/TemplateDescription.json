You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

Some state variables and programming specifications are provided to help you develop. The following is the description of the contract logic: For the function setArbitrator, it has one argument and its type is address.\n  For the element in the owner:\n  - the state variable arbitrator will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the function withdrawAccumulatedFees, it has one argument and its type is address.\n  For the element in the owner:\n  - it transfers ether valued accumulatedgasfees to the first argument. Afterthat, \n    - the state variable accumulatedgasfees will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the function reclaimToken, it has one argument and its type is address.\n  For the element in the owner:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: the element in the owner, and v0.\n\nFor the function transferOwnership, it has one argument and its type is address.\n  - the value the first argument will be put to the element in the owner.\n\nFor the function release, it has one argument and its type is string.\n  For arbitrator, and the element in the owner is greater than 0, and ((0xb3a5*gasprice)/0xb3a5) equals to gasprice, and (0xb3a5*gasprice) is not greater than the element in the owner with index 2, and (accumulatedgasfees+(0xb3a5*gasprice)) is not smaller than accumulatedgasfees:\n  -

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
