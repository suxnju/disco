It has a `isValidSignature` function that uses `ecrecover` to verify a signature. There's a `transferFrom` function for transferring tokens, an `addSigner` function for adding a signer, a `transferOwnership` function for transferring ownership of the contract, a `deposit` function for allowing deposits, and a `withdraw` function for allowing withdrawals. The contract uses mappings for storing balances and deposit locks. It also includes a require statement for ensuring the `_value` is not larger than the sender's balance.",
