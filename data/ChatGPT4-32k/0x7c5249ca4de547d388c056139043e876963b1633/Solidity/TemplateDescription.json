You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

The following is the description of the contract logic: For the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the allowance from caller to the first argument is 0, and the second argument is greater than 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is greater than 0:\n  - the state variable totalSupply2 will be updated to (totalSupply2+(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/totalsupply)).\n\nFor the setShare function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable sharecontract will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the setJackpot function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable jackpot will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the payable increaseProfit function.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is greater than 0:\n  - the state variable totalSupply2 will be updated to (totalSupply2+(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/totalsupply)).\n\nFor the setFinance function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable finance will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the updateContract function.\n- For owner:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to owner.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n  - When the second argument does not equal to the first argument, and the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument, and the second argument is not 0, and the third argument is greater than 0:\n    - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the third argument+the balance of the second argument).\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n    - When the third argument is 0:\n      - the balance2 of the first argument will be updated to the balance2 of the first argument.\n      - the balance3 of the second argument will be updated to the balance3 of the second argument.\n    - When the third argument is not 0:\n      - the balance2 of the first argument will be updated to ((totalSupply2*the third argument)+the balance2 of the first argument).\n      - the balance3 of the second argument will be updated to ((totalSupply2*the third argument)+the balance3 of the second argument).\n\nFor the withdraw function.\n- When (the balance2 of caller-the balance3 of caller) is greater than 0, and totalSupply2 is 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued (the balance2 of caller-the balance3 of caller) to caller. Afterthat, \n    - the balance3 of caller will be updated to ((the balance2 of caller-the balance3 of caller)+the balance3 of caller).\n- When ((the balance2 of caller+(the balance of caller*totalSupply2))-the balance3 of caller) is greater than 0, and totalSupply2 is not 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued ((the balance2 of caller+(the balance of caller*totalSupply2))-the balance3 of caller) to caller. Afterthat, \n    - the balance3 of caller will be updated to (((the balance2 of caller+(the balance of caller*totalSupply2))-the balance3 of caller)+the balance3 of caller).\n\nFor the sendRTB function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to the address of this contract, and for owner, and the second argument is not greater than the balance of the address of this contract, and the first argument is not 0, and the second argument is greater than 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n  - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to (the balance of the address of this contract-the second argument).\n  - the state variable totalsold will be updated to (the second argument+totalsold).\n  - When the second argument is 0:\n    - the balance2 of the address of this contract will be updated to the balance2 of the address of this contract.\n    - the balance3 of the first argument will be updated to the balance3 of the first argument.\n  - When the second argument is not 0:\n    - the balance2 of the address of this contract will be updated to ((totalSupply2*the second argument)+the balance2 of the address of this contract).\n    - the balance3 of the first argument will be updated to ((totalSupply2*the second argument)+the balance3 of the first argument).\n\nFor the devWithdraw function.\n- For owner:\n  - When totalSupply2 is 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (the balance2 of the address of this contract-the balance3 of the address of this contract) to caller. Afterthat, \n      - the balance3 of the address of this contract will be updated to ((the balance2 of the address of this contract-the balance3 of the address of this contract)+the balance3 of the address of this contract).\n  - When totalSupply2 is not 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued ((the balance2 of the address of this contract+(the balance of the address of this contract*totalSupply2))-the balance3 of the address of this contract) to caller. Afterthat, \n      - the balance3 of the address of this contract will be updated to (((the balance2 of the address of this contract+(the balance of the address of this contract*totalSupply2))-the balance3 of the address of this contract)+the balance3 of the address of this contract).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is greater than 0, and the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and for users, except for the first argument, and the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - When the second argument is 0:\n    - the balance2 of caller will be updated to the balance2 of caller.\n    - the balance3 of the first argument will be updated to the balance3 of the first argument.\n  - When the second argument is not 0:\n    - the balance2 of caller will be updated to ((totalSupply2*the second argument)+the balance2 of caller).\n    - the balance3 of the first argument will be updated to ((totalSupply2*the second argument)+the balance3 of the first argument).\n\nFor the payable buy function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is not greater than the balance of the address of this contract, and the first argument is greater than 0, and the first argument is 0, and caller is not 0, and the first argument is not greater than (totalsupply-totalsold), and for users, except for the address of this contract, and 0 equals to the ether just received (i.e., msg.value):\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the first argument+the balance of caller).\n  - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to (the balance of the address of this contract-the first argument).\n  - the balance2 of the address of this contract will be updated to the balance2 of the address of this contract.\n  - the balance3 of caller will be updated to the balance3 of caller.\n  - it transfers ether valued 0 to finance.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it transfers ether valued 0 to jackpot.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it calls an external function increaseProfit of the external contract sharecontract.\n      - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n        - the state variable totalsold will be updated to (the first argument+totalsold).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalsold` is typed uint256,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `finance` is typed address,private state variable `balanceOf3` is typed mapping,private state variable `totalSupply2` is typed uint256,public state variable `jackpot` is typed address,public state variable `sharecontract` is typed address,private state variable `balanceOf2` is typed mapping,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
