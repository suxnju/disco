I'll need more specific details to provide an accurate Solidity contract. However, I can provide an example of a basic Solidity smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract SimpleStorage {\n  uint storedData;\n\n  function set(uint x) public {\n    storedData = x;\n  }\n\n  function get() public view returns (uint) {\n    return storedData;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis contract has a simple function to set and get a uint value. If you provide more information about the specific contract you're trying to recreate, I can provide a more accurate contract.",
