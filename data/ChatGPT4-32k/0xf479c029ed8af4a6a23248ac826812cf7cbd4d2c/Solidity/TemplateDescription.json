				"content": "Sure, here is a contract code based on the given description. Please note that due to the complexity of the logic, the contract might need further testing and debugging.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.16;\n\ncontract Upgradeable {\n    address public implementation;\n    string public version;\n    address public upgradeabilityowner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        upgradeabilityowner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function upgradeTo(string memory _version, address _implementation) public {\n        require(msg.sender == upgradeabilityowner, \"Only owner can upgrade\");\n        require(_implementation != implementation, \"Cannot upgrade to the same implementation\");\n        implementation = _implementation;\n        version = _version;\n    }\n\n    function transferProxyOwnership(address newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == upgradeabilityowner, \"Only owner can transfer ownership\");\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"New owner address should be valid\");\n        upgradeabilityowner = newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function () external payable {\n        require(implementation != address(0), \"Implementation not set\");\n        bytes memory data = msg.data;\n        assembly {\n            let result := delegatecall(gas, implementation, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)\n            let size := returndatasize\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\n            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)\n            switch result\n            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }\n            default { return(ptr, size) }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract includes an upgradeable proxy. The contract owner can upgrade the implementation of the contract, change the version, and transfer the ownership of the contract. The fallback function delegates all calls to the current implementation. \n\nPlease note that the logic of the function `upgradeTo` in the provided description is quite complex and unclear, so I simplified it. In the current version, if the caller is the contract owner and the new implementation address is different from the current one, then the contract will be upgraded. If you provide a clearer description, I can help you modify the contract.\n\nPlease also note that the `delegatecall` function is a low-level function with security risks, you should be very careful when using it.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
