If the token contract doesn't have this function or it has a different signature, the `sendTokensToMe` function will fail. \n\nAlso, please be aware that the `sendToMe` function sends all Ether that the contract owns to the owner. If you don't want to send all Ether, you should replace `address(this).balance` with the amount you want to send.",
