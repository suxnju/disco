Due to the character limit, not all functions could be included, particularly `transfer`, `approveAndCall`, and `rewardActivityEnd`. \n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version and does not include safety checks for arithmetic operations (you should use a library like SafeMath for this), does not make external calls with `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`, does not check whether the user's address is empty before transferring, does not handle payable addresses correctly, and does not include events for state changes. \n\nYou should add these features and complete the remaining functions for a full contract. And always make sure to thoroughly test your contract and ideally have it audited by a professional before using it in production.",
