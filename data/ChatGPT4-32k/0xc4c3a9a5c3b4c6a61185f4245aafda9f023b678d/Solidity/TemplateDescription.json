If it is, it transfers the difference to the address passed as an argument.\n- Allows the `owner` to set the fee amount via the `setHubrisOneFees` function.\n- Allows the `owner` to collect the balance of the contract via the `collect` function.\n- Allows the `owner` to transfer ownership of the contract to a new owner via the `transferOwnership` function.",
