The following is the description of the contract logic: For the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and for users, except for 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the decreaseAllowance function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the allowance from caller to the first argument, and for users, except for 0, and the first argument does not equal to 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the allowance from caller to the first argument-the second argument).\n\nFor the increaseAllowance function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and (the allowance from caller to the first argument+the second argument) is not smaller than the allowance from caller to the first argument, and for users, except for 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the allowance from caller to the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the payable withdraw function.\n- When totalsupply is greater than 0, and (the balance of the address of this contract+totalethwithdraw) is not smaller than the balance of the address of this contract:\n  - the state variable dividendpertoken will be updated to ((the balance of the address of this contract+totalethwithdraw)/totalsupply).\n  - When the dividendcredited of caller is not greater than dividendpertoken:\n    - When the balance of caller equals to 0:\n      - the balance2 of caller will be updated to 0.\n    - the dividendcredited of caller will be updated to dividendpertoken.\n    - When ((the balance of caller*(dividendpertoken-the dividendcredited of caller))/the balance of caller) equals to (dividendpertoken-the dividendcredited of caller), and for users, except the balance of caller equals to 0:\n      - the balance2 of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller*(dividendpertoken-the dividendcredited of caller)).
