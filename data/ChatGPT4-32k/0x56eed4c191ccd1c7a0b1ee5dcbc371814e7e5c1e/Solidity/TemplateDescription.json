Please run tests before using it.\n- This contract does not implement any overflow or underflow checks. Consider using a library like SafeMath for this.\n- This contract does not check if the provided address is non-zero before transferring ether to it.\n- This contract uses the `call` function to transfer ether, which can potentially enable reentrancy attacks. Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent this.\n- This contract does not emit any events. Consider emitting events for important state changes.",
