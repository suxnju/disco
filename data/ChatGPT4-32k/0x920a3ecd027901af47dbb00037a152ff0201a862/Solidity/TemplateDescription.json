Therefore, the multiplication operation you requested (`isstillprime[address(_arg2 * _arg1)]`) is converted to an address type but it does not represent a meaningful Ethereum address.\n\nThe contract has two functions: `deposit` and `factor`. \n\n`deposit` function is payable and accepts an argument `_arg`. It increases the value of `isstillprime` mapping of the caller by the amount of ether sent.\n\n`factor` function accepts three arguments, a payable address `_to`, and two uint `_arg1` and `_arg2`. If the conditions are met, it transfers the ether held in `isstillprime` of `_to` and/or `isstillprime` of the address derived from `_arg1` and `_arg2` multiplication to `_to`, and resets the `isstillprime` of these addresses to 0.",
