It also has an `approveOracle` function that only the `owner` can call to set a particular oracle's balance to 1, and a `revokeOracle` function that only the `owner` can call to set a particular oracle's balance to 0. \n\nThe `setStatus` function is also only callable by the `owner` and updates the contract's `status` state variable to a new value, so long as the new value and current `status` are not greater than 3.\n\nAll these functions are secured by an `owner` check, which reverts the transaction if the caller is not the `owner`. The `setStatus` function also checks that the new status value is not greater than 3 before updating the `status` state variable.",
