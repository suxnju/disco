It also checks for underflow before performing the transfer. The transfer is done using `.call()` method.\n\nI've also implemented a function `getBlockProperties()` to return the current block's number, timestamp, and hash of the previous block.\n\nLastly, `hashData()` is a function that takes a string input and returns its Keccak-256 and SHA-256 hashes. These are computed using the `keccak256()` and `sha256()` functions respectively, with the input string encoded using `abi.encodePacked()`.",
