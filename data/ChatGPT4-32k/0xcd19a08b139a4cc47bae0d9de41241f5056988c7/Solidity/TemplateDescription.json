The `approve`, `transfer`, and `transferFrom` functions are standard ERC20 functions. The `createTokens` function can be used to create new tokens in exchange for Ether, at a rate of 10000 tokens per Ether. Note that the `msg.sender` is always taken as the transaction sender, and the `msg.value` as the transaction's attached Ether value. We also have a fallback function that creates tokens whenever Ether is sent to the contract.",
