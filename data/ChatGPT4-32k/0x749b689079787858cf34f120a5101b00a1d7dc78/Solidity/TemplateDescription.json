The return value is decoded from bytes to uint256.\n- The `setReferalCommission` function changes the balance of the provided address by subtracting 5 from the provided value, but only if the provided value is between 5 and 95 and only if the function caller is the owner of the contract.\n- The `renounceOwnership` function changes the owner of the contract to the zero address, but only if the function caller is the owner of the contract.\n- The `setRate` function changes the rate state variable to the provided value, but only if the function caller is the owner of the contract.\n- The `withdraw` function transfers the provided value from the contract to the owner, but only if the function caller is the owner of the contract and only if the contract has enough balance.\n- The `transferOwnership` function changes the owner of the contract to the provided address, but only if the function caller is the owner of the contract and the provided address is not the zero address.\n- The `buy` function transfers tokens from the contract to the function caller based on the rate and the amount of Ether sent with the function call. If the provided address is not the zero address and is not the sender of the transaction, it also sends a commission to the provided address based on its balance and the amount of Ether sent with the function call.",
