The owner can also transfer ownership of the contract to a new owner. The contract includes safety checks to ensure that only the owner can perform certain operations, and that the amount of ether sent is within a certain range. It also ensures that the token and wallet addresses are not zero. The contract emits events when ownership is transferred and tokens are purchased.",
