the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\nFor the approveAndCall function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n- When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n  - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n- When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n  - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n  - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n    - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n      - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the sell function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the balance of the address of this contract is not smaller than (the first argument*sellprice), and the frozenaccount of the address of this contract is 0, and the balance of caller is not smaller than the first argument, and (the balance of the address of this contract+the first argument) is greater than the balance of the address of this contract, and the address of this contract is not 0, and the frozenaccount of caller is 0:\n  -
