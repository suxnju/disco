It includes 4 functions: 'found', 'setOfficialWebsite', 'invest', and a fallback function. All functions are set to payable to allow them to receive and transfer ethers. 'currentmanager' is set to receive a portion of ethers in the 'invest' and fallback function. The contract also includes checks for conditions and ensures safe transfer of ethers using the .call method.",
