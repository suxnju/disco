This logic might need to be revised as the only integer satisfying both conditions is 0.\n- The `normalized_token_prices` function in the provided description is not detailed enough to implement the exact logic, especially regarding the use of `0x313ce567` and `0xafb1f8d6`. In the code above, I've placed placeholders for the actual method names to be called. \n- It's necessary to ensure the functions being called on the `_arg` and `daioracleaddress` addresses are `payable` and accept the correct arguments, if they are meant to receive ether or other specific arguments.",
