Note that the contract uses SafeMath-like checks to prevent overflows and underflows (for example, checking that `balanceOf[msg.sender] + nextFreeCount > balanceOf[msg.sender]` before adding `nextFreeCount` to `balanceOf[msg.sender]`). The `safeWithdrawal` function uses `.call{value: ...}(\"\")` instead of `.transfer(...)`. The `renounceOwnership`, `transferOwnership`, and `safeWithdrawal` functions are protected by a `require(msg.sender == owner)` check, so only the current owner can call them.",
