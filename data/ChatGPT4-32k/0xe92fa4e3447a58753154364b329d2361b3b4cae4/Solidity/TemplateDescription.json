But you need to be aware that this is a dangerous contract. It makes a transfer of Ether based on the result of a `sha256` call with no apparent checks on who is making the call or what the inputs are. It's also not clear what the mappings represent or how they're supposed to be used. You should definitely not use this contract on the mainnet or in any situation where real value could be lost.",
