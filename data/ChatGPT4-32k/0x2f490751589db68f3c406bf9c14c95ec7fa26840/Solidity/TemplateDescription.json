You should always use libraries like SafeMath to prevent such issues. Also, it's essential to validate user addresses before making any transfers. For simplicity and readability, these checks are not included in the above code. \n\nPlease note, the contract assumes the existence of external contracts named `IERC20` and `UnicornRanch` with the specified methods.",
