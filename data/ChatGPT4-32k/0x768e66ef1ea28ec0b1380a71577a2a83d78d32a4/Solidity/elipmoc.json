				"content": "The Solidity contract, which is based on the provided decompiled code, would look something like this:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address private _updateUSeqgret; // from STORAGE[0x0] bytes 0 to 19\n\n    receive() external payable {\n        revert();\n    }\n\n    function updateUSeqgret() public payable { \n        require(_updateUSeqgret == msg.sender, \"You are not authorized!\");\n        (bool success,) = _updateUSeqgret.call{value: address(this).balance - msg.value, gas: 2300 * (address(this).balance - msg.value == 0 ? 0 : 1)}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Call failed!\");\n    }\n\n    // Note: The function selector is not present in the original solidity code.\n    // However, we display it for the sake of completeness.\n    fallback() external payable {\n        bytes4 function_selector = msg.sig;\n        if (function_selector == 0x8f62b028) {\n            updateUSeqgret();\n        } else {\n            revert();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that I've assumed that the original code was using a low-level call to the `_updateUSeqgret` address, which is a quite risky operation and is not recommended unless you know what you're doing. If you have more context or details about what the original contract was supposed to do, you may want to replace this with a higher-level call to a known contract interface.\n\nAlso, note that the `__function_selector__` function was translated to the fallback function in Solidity, which is triggered when the function signature doesn't match any of the existing functions in the contract. The function selector (`msg.sig`) is directly accessible in Solidity.",
