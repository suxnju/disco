It requires some ether to be sent while deploying and assigns the sender as the owner of the contract. \n\nThe `updateUSeqgret` function can only be called by the owner of the contract. It calculates the difference between the current contract balance and the amount of ether just received, and then transfers this amount to the owner.\n\nThe `getBalance` function is to help check the current balance of the contract.\n\nPlease note that this contract doesn't use methods like `abi.encodePacked`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ecrecover`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `blockhash` because they were not required based on your description. If you need a contract that uses those methods, please provide a specific scenario or contract logic.",
