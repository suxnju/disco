It also maintains balances of tokens for each address, allowances for eliminating and transferring tokens, total supply of tokens, and prices for buying and selling tokens. The contract ensures that all operations are valid before they are executed. For example, it verifies that the sender has enough tokens to transfer or eliminate, or that the receiver can accept more tokens. It also updates the total supply of tokens and prices accordingly.",
