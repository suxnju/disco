The `onlyAdmin` modifier is used to ensure that only the admin can call certain functions. The `fallback` function is used to handle calls to the contract that don't match any of the other functions. The `calculateTransferAmount` and `calculatePaymentAmount` functions are used to calculate the amount of tokens to transfer or the amount of payment to make, respectively.\n\nPlease note that this code is not thoroughly tested and might contain bugs. Always perform a thorough audit and test before deploying any smart contract.",
