If the hashValue is within a range of values, the owner, totalsupply, and balanceof are updated. The approve function allows the caller to approve another address to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. The etherProceeds function allows the owner to withdraw all ether from the contract. The transferFrom function allows an approved address to transfer tokens from one address to another. The transferOwnership function allows the owner to transfer ownership of the contract to another address. The transfer function allows the caller to transfer tokens to another address.",
