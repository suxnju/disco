For instance, in a production-ready contract, you would want to emit events for significant actions, do more edge-case handling, and possibly add more comments to your code.",

For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    -
