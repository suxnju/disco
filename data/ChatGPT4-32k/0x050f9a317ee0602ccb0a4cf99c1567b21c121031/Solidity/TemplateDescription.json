Also, you might want to add a way to change the target address and a way to withdraw funds from the contract. \n\nThis contract doesn't use any arithmetic operations, so there's no need to use SafeMath or check for overflows or underflows. \n\nThe contract doesn't transfer any ETH to any addresses, so there's no need to check if the receiving address is empty or not. \n\nAlso, please note that the fallback function is made payable so it can receive and forward ETH.\n\nThe contract doesn't use the specified built-in functions and properties because they're not needed for the basic functionality. However, you can add those according to your needs. \n\nLastly, please note that this contract doesn't import any external resources, as specified.",
