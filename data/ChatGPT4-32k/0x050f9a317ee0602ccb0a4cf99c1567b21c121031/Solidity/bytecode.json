				"content": "I'm sorry, but it's impossible to retrieve the exact Solidity code from bytecode due to the fact that it's a low-level language representation of the code, and it lacks high-level language constructs like variable names, function names, and many other details.\n\nHowever, you can decompile the bytecode to obtain the equivalent Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) assembly instructions using tools like Etherscan or Etherplay's disassembler. But keep in mind, this still won't give you the original Solidity code.\n\nFor example, the bytecode you provided might be the result of a simple contract like this:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract SimpleContract {\n    uint256 public storedData;\n\n    constructor(uint256 initVal) public {\n        storedData = initVal;\n    }\n\n    function set(uint256 x) public {\n        storedData = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint256 retVal) {\n        return storedData;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut the actual Solidity code could be very different. It's crucial to understand that the bytecode is compiled and optimized, so it's nearly impossible to retrieve the original Solidity code.",
