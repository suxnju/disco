You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the balances of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the balances of caller).\n\nFor the function withdrawToken, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n  When the second argument is not greater than the tokens from caller to the first argument:\n  - the tokens from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the tokens from caller to the first argument-the second argument).\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\nFor the function transferOwnership, it has one argument and its type is address.\n  For owner, and the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the function setCoeff, it has 5 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: uint8, uint128, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n  - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3((the address of this contract),(caller),(0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000*the first argument),(0x100000000000000000000000000000000*the second argument, the third argument, the fourth argument, and the fifth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  When v0 equals to signer, and the first argument is smaller than 100, and the second argument is greater than current time, and the second argument is not greater than (current time+0x2e2480):\n  - the coeffs of caller will be updated to the first argument.\n  - the coeffs of caller will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the function addPack, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: uint8, uint128, uint256.\n  For owner, and the first argument is smaller than 100, and the second argument is greater than 0, and the third argument is greater than 0:\n  - the packs of (the first argument+(the second argument*256)) will be updated to the third argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `paused` is typed bool,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `fee_mul` is typed uint256,public state variable `expiredelay` is typed uint256,public state variable `feecollector` is typed address,public state variable `makefee` is typed uint256,public state variable `takefee` is typed uint256,public state variable `balances` is typed mapping,public state variable `tokens` is typed mapping,public state variable `filled` is typed mapping,public state variable `trades` is typed mapping,public state variable `signer` is typed address,public state variable `coeffs` is typed mapping,public state variable `packs` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
