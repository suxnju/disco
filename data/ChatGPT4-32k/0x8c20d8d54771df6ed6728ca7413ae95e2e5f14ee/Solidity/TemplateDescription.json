The commands related to the SHA3 hash function are not available in solidity and have been removed from the code. The `approveAndCall` function is written assuming an external function `receiveApproval` exists in the spender contract. The `transferAnyERC20Token` function is written assuming the ERC20 token is compatible with the ERC20Interface.",
