You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

For cloverscontroller:\n    - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the third argument with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n  - For users, except for cloverscontroller, and for owner:\n    - it calls an external function watch_tg_invmru_2f69f1b of the third argument with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the balance of caller, and the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the first argument is not 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the burn function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - For clubtokencontroller:\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the second argument).\n    - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the second argument).\n  - For users, except for clubtokencontroller:\n    - For cloverscontroller:\n      - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the second argument).\n      - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the second argument).\n    - For owner, and for users, except for cloverscontroller:\n      - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the second argument).\n      - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (totalsupply-the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `mintingfinished` is typed bool,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `cloverscontroller` is typed address,public state variable `clubtokencontroller` is typed address.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
