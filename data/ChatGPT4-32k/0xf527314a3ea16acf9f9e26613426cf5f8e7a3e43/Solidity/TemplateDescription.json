The fallback function calls the `logEthDeposit` function in an external contract (`token`). The `logEthDeposit` function is called with the sender's address, this contract's address, and the amount of Ether sent.\n\nThe `sweep` function calls the `sweeperOf` function in an external contract (`token`). The `sweeperOf` function is called with the address from the function arguments. The returned value is used to delegate a call to the `sweep` function. \n\nPlease note that the provided contract only includes the described logic and doesn't include any checks for overflow/underflow or checks for empty addresses, as it's not clear where these checks should be performed based on the provided description. \n\nAlso, this contract doesn't use the methods `abi.encodePacked`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ecrecover`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `blockhash` because it's not clear where these methods should be used based on the provided description.",
