The contract uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows. The contract also checks for a valid sender address and that the investment is greater than zero. The contract updates the state variables based on the logic provided in the description. However, the code is quite repetitive and could potentially be simplified and optimized.",
