Only the `owner` can transfer Ether from the contract to a specified address using the `transferEther` function. The address receiving Ether must not be the zero address, and there must be enough Ether in the contract balance to cover the transfer amount.\n\nThe contract also includes a fallback function marked with the `receive` keyword to allow it to receive Ether.\n\nLastly, there is a `withdraw` function which allows the `owner` to withdraw any Ether in the contract, useful in case any Ether was accidentally sent to the contract.\n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any arithmetic operations, hence, there is no need for safemath operations to prevent overflows or underflows. However, if arithmetic operations are to be included in the contract, a library such as OpenZeppelin's SafeMath should be used to prevent such issues.",
