Afterthat, \n    - the nonces of the first argument will be updated to (the nonces of the first argument+1).\n  - When v0 equals to the first argument, and the call or transfer succeeds, and v0 is not 0:\n    - the allowance from the first argument to the second argument will be updated to the third argument.\n\nFor the payable transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument-the third argument) is not greater than the balance of the first argument:\n  - When 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff equals to the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n    - When (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is not smaller than the balance of the second argument:\n      - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n  - When (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument) is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller, and for users, except 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff equals to the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n    - When (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is not smaller than the balance of the second argument:\n      - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n- When (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument) is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller, and for users, except 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff equals to the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the payable transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of caller-the second argument) is not greater than the balance of caller:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is not smaller than the balance of the first argument:\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the payable sync function.\n- When 1 equals to s_12:\n  - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 0.\n  - it statically calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token0 with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it statically calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token1 with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v1 is not greater than 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, and v0 is not greater than 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffff:\n      - the state variable reserves will be updated to v0.\n      - the state variable s_8_4_18 will be updated to v1.\n      - the state variable s_8_0_4 will be updated to current time.\n      - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 1.\n      - When (current time-s_8_0_4) is not 0, and reserves is not 0, and s_8_4_18 is not 0:\n        - the state variable price0cumulativelast will be updated to ((((0x10000000000000000000000000000*s_8_4_18)/reserves)*(current time-s_8_0_4))+price0cumulativelast).\n        - the state variable price1cumulativelast will be updated to ((((0x10000000000000000000000000000*reserves)/s_8_4_18)*(current time-s_8_0_4))+price1cumulativelast).\n\nFor the payable skim function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When 1 equals to s_12:\n  - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 0.\n  - it statically calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token0 with the address of this contract as the argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds, and (v0-reserves) is not greater than v0:\n    - it statically calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token1 with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token0 with the following argument list: 28 V107@0x2029@0x1fdb 4, and 28 V93@0x2271@0x226e 4 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or 0.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it statically calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token1 with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n      - When the call or transfer succeeds, and (v0-s_8_4_18) is not greater than v0:\n        - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token1 with the following argument list: 28 V236@0x2029@0x1fdb 4, and 28 V222@0x2271@0x226e 4 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or 0.\n        - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 1.\n        - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n          - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 1.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds, and (v0-s_8_4_18) is not greater than v0:\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token1 with the following argument list: 28 V239@0x2029@0x1fdb 4, and 28 V225@0x2271@0x226e 4 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or 0.\n      - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 1.\n      - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n        - the state variable s_12 will be updated to 1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `fopwcdkkk` is typed uint256,public state variable `nonces` is typed mapping,public state variable `factory` is typed address,public state variable `token0` is typed address,public state variable `token1` is typed address,private state variable `s_8_0_4` is typed uint32,private state variable `s_8_4_18` is typed uint112,public state variable `reserves` is typed uint112,public state variable `price0cumulativelast` is typed uint256,public state variable `price1cumulativelast` is typed uint256,public state variable `klast` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_12` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
