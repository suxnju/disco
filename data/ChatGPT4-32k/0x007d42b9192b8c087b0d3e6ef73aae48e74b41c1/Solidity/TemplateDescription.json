Therefore, the above code is an approximation based on the given descriptions. The `Enter` function is overloaded to serve as the `fallback` function since there is no explicit fallback function in Solidity 0.6.x. The `s_1`, `s_3`, `s_6`, `s_9`, and `s_12` variables and the `ManualDeposit`, `Emergency`, and `NewManualInvestor` functions are used in the contract as placeholders as they are mentioned in the problem but their logic is not clearly defined.",
