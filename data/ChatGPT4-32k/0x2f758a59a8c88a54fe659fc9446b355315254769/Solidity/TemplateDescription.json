These functions need to be correctly implemented in the `typetoken` contract and should follow the standard ERC20 interface. Also, the exchangeTokens function does not check for underflows when subtracting amountTokens from unburnedtypetokens. Please ensure that the logic of your application prevents this from happening or use a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to handle this automatically.",
