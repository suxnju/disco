				"content": "Below is a simple contract code that fits the given descriptions:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\ncontract MyContract {\n    address private owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function destroy() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can destroy the contract.\");\n        selfdestruct(payable(owner));\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this contract, the constructor function sets the `owner` of the contract to be the address that deploys the contract. The `destroy` function can only be called by the `owner` and it destructs the contract and sends all remaining ether balance to the `owner`. \n\nNote:\n1. `selfdestruct` function is used to destroy the contract. It also sends all remaining Ether stored at the contract to the specified address.\n2. `payable` keyword is used so that the address can receive Ether.\n3. `require` function is used to ensure that only the `owner` can call the `destroy` function. If the `require` condition is not met, the transaction is reverted.\n4. There's no arithmetic operation in this contract, so there's no need to check for overflow or underflow. \n5. The `owner` address is not checked if it's empty because it's set to `msg.sender` in the constructor and can't be changed afterwards. This makes sure it's never empty.\n6. None of the mentioned built-in functions or properties are used in this contract as they are not needed based on the provided contract logic.",
