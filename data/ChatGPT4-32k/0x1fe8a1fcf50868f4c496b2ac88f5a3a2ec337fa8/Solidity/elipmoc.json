Solidity doesn't support emitting raw keccak256 hashes directly. Hence, an event `LogFallback` is created to simulate this behavior.\n\n2. In the `destroy()` function, `_destroy` is typecasted to `address payable` as `selfdestruct` requires an `address payable` parameter.\n\n3. Solidity doesn't directly support the `__function_selector__` syntax. Hence, this function is renamed to `function_selector`.\n\n4. The `fallback()` function is marked as `external` to ensure it can only be called from outside the contract.\n\n5. `MEM[64] = 128;` is not included in the contract as it's not valid Solidity syntax. It's EVM-specific code that doesn't have a direct equivalent in Solidity.",
