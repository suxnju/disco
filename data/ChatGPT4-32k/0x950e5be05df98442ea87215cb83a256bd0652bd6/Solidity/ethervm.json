				"content": "Based on the given decompiled code, here is the Solidity equivalent:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Contract {\n    function main() public payable {\n        assembly {\n            let x := mload(0x40)\n            mstore(x, 0x80)\n            if lt(calldatasize(), 0x04) {\n                if iszero(calldatasize()) {\n                    stop()\n                } else {\n                    revert(0, 0)\n                }\n            } else {\n                revert(0, 0)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nHere is the explanation of the code:\n\nThe `assembly` keyword allows you to write inline assembly language in Solidity code. It's a low-level language with a simple syntax that maps directly to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) instructions.\n\n`mload(0x40)` returns the value at memory address 0x40, which is a special address in Solidity. This address is used as a \"free memory pointer\", where Solidity keeps track of the currently available memory slot.\n\n`mstore(x, 0x80)` then stores the value 0x80 in the memory slot at position x.\n\nThe condition `lt(calldatasize(), 0x04)` checks if the size of the data sent with the message is less than 4 bytes. If it's less and there's no data sent (`iszero(calldatasize())`), the contract execution is stopped.\n\nThe `revert(0, 0)` instruction causes an exception to stop the execution and revert all changes to the state. The zeros indicate that no additional data is returned with the revert.\n\nPlease note that using inline assembly is not recommended for most developers, as it bypasses several important safety features of Solidity. It should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.",
