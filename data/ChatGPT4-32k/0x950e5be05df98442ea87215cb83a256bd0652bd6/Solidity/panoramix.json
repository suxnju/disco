				"content": "Given that the decompiled code is not complete and doesn't provide enough details, I'll provide a solidity contract example that includes a fallback function. The fallback function will be payable and will include require statements similar to your decompiled code. However, it's important to note that in Solidity, the calldata size cannot be smaller than 4 bytes if it contains a function selector.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    // Fallback function\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size must be less than 4\");\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Calldata size must be zero\");\n    }\n\n    // Function to retrieve the contract balance\n    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {\n        return address(this).balance;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `fallback` function is a special function in Solidity that is executed when the contract receives plain Ether (without data) or if no other function matches the given function signature. \n\nThe `require` statements ensure that the length of the calldata is less than 4 and equal to zero. However, this condition will never be true and will always throw an exception if any ether is sent to the contract. \n\nThe `getBalance` function returns the balance of the contract.\n\nPlease note that in practice, a calldata size of less than 4 is not practical if you're expecting any interaction with your contract apart from just receiving Ether.",
