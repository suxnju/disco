This contract might not compile because of the missing parts. It's also important to note that the external function calls are simplified and don't handle potential failures. You should add proper error handling to these calls.\n\nPlease note that this code is not complete and is provided as a starting point. It's crucial to fully understand the business logic, security considerations, and Solidity programming language before deploying a smart contract.",

typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply3` is typed uint256,private state variable `balanceOf` is typed mapping,private state variable `amounts1` is typed array,private state variable `balanceOf1` is typed mapping,private state variable `tokenURI2` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf2` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf3` is typed mapping,private state variable `tokenURI1` is typed mapping,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `amounts` is typed array,private state variable `totalSupply2` is typed uint256,private state variable `tokenURI` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply3` is typed uint256,private state variable `balanceOf` is typed mapping,private state variable `amounts1` is typed array,private state variable `balanceOf1` is typed mapping,private state variable `tokenURI2` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf2` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf3` is typed mapping,private state variable `tokenURI1` is typed mapping,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `amounts` is typed array,private state variable `totalSupply2` is typed uint256,private state variable `tokenURI` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
