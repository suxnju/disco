The constructor initializes the contract with the sender as `crowdsaleowner` and sets `ethercost` to 470. `checkGoalReached()` updates the `fundinggoalreached` and `crowdsaleclosed` variables based on the balance of `rewardtoken` in `crowdsalewallet`. `withdraw()` allows `crowdsalebeneficiary` to withdraw `amountraised`. `updateEtherCost(uint256 newcost)` allows `crowdsaleowner` to update `ethercost`.",
