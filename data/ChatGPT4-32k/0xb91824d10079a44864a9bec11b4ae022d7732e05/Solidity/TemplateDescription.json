The `fallback` function is used to receive ether and update balances. The `checkGoalReached` function checks if the funding goal has been reached after the deadline. The `issue` function issues new tokens to a specified address. The `transfer` function transfers tokens from the caller to a specified address. The `safeWithdrawal` function allows contributors to withdraw their contributions if the funding goal is not reached, and the beneficiary to withdraw the raised amount if the funding goal is reached.",
