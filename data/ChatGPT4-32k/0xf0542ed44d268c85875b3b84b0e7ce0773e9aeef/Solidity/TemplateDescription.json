The `purchasePosition` function allows a user to purchase a position if they provide the correct amount of Ether, and the `reg` function allows a user to register an account if they provide the correct amount of Ether and a valid referrer.\n\nPlease note that for security reasons, I used the `.call` function instead of `.transfer` or `.send`. This is because the `.call` function does not limit the amount of gas that can be used by the called contract, which prevents re-entrancy attacks.",
