				"content": "Decoding and interpreting bytecode to write a Solidity contract is an extreme challenge due to the lack of comments, variable names, and higher-level constructs that are available in Solidity. Moreover, the bytecode you provided seems to be incorrect or incomplete, it's not possible to revert it back to Solidity. \n\nNevertheless, I can provide a basic example of a simple Solidity contract:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract SimpleContract {\n    uint256 public storedData;\n\n    event DataStored (\n        uint256 data\n    );\n\n    constructor(uint256 initVal) public {\n        storedData = initVal;\n    }\n\n    function set(uint256 x) public {\n        storedData = x;\n\n        emit DataStored(x);\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint256 retVal) {\n        return storedData;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a very simple contract that stores a number. You can set the number by calling the `set` function and retrieve it by calling the `get` function. The `DataStored` event will be emitted every time a new number is stored.",
