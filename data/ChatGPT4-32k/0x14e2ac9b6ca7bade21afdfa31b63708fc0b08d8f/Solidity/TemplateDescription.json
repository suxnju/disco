				"content": "Sure, based on your description, here is a Solidity contract:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract KingOfEther {\n    uint256 public timelimit;\n    uint256 public lastking;\n    address payable public owner;\n    address payable public currentking;\n    address payable[] public previousentries;\n\n    constructor() payable public {\n        timelimit = 3600;\n        if (msg.value == 0) {\n            owner = msg.sender;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function seed() payable public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can seed the contract\");\n        lastking = block.timestamp;\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.value == 0x16345785d8a0000, \"Invalid amount of Ether sent\");\n        lastking = block.timestamp;\n        previousentries.push(currentking);\n        currentking = msg.sender;\n        \n        if (lastking + timelimit < block.timestamp) {\n            require(currentking != address(0), \"No current king to send Ether to\");\n            (bool success, ) = currentking.call{value: address(this).balance - 0x16345785d8a0000}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract implements the following logic:\n\n- A constructor that updates the `timelimit` to 3600 and sets the `owner` to the caller if no Ether is sent while deploying the contract.\n\n- A `seed` function that only the `owner` can call, which updates the `lastking` to the current time.\n\n- A fallback function that updates the `lastking` to the current time, adds the `currentking` to the `previousentries` array, and sets the `currentking` to the caller, if the sent Ether equals to `0x16345785d8a0000`. If `(lastking + timelimit)` is smaller than the current time, it transfers the balance of the contract minus `0x16345785d8a0000` to `currentking`.\n\nPlease note that due to the nature of the `fallback` function, it's not possible to add more arguments or return values to it. If you need more functionality, consider adding more public functions to the contract.",
