Afterthat, \n    - the balance of supplier will be updated to (the balance of supplier-the balance of supplier).\n  - the state variable supplier will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the payable transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When (the balance of the first argument+the second argument) is not smaller than the balance of the first argument, and the balance of caller is not smaller than the second argument:\n  - After 0x59923980:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n  - Before 0x59923980, and for supplier:\n    - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the payable referral function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the balance of the first argument is not smaller than 0xc097ce7bc90715b34b9f1000000000, and referral equals to 1, and sale equals to 1, and the balance of supplier is not smaller than (((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*(100+bounty)), and (the balance of caller+(((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*(100+bounty))) is not smaller than the balance of caller:\n  - the balance of supplier will be updated to (the balance of supplier-(((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*(100+bounty))).\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+(((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*(100+bounty))).\n  - When (the balance of the first argument+(((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*bounty)) is not smaller than the balance of the first argument, and the balance of supplier is not smaller than (((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*bounty):\n    - the balance of supplier will be updated to (the balance of supplier-(((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*bounty)).\n    - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+(((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*blnpereth)/100)*bounty)).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `supplier` is typed address,public state variable `blnpereth` is typed uint256,public state variable `bounty` is typed uint256,public state variable `referral` is typed bool,public state variable `sale` is typed bool,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
