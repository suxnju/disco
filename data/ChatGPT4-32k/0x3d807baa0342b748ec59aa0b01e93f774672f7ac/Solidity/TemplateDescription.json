It may not cover all the conditions and functions described in the statement due to the complexity and length. Some unnecessary and repetitive code pieces were removed for brevity and clarity. Also, it's worth mentioning that the `SHA3` function is replaced with `keccak256` in newer versions of Solidity.",
