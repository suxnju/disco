It includes the state variables, the constructor function, and the other functions described, and uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions to the contract owner. It also includes appropriate checks for conditions such as sufficient funds and allowances. For the `purchaseToken` function, it calculates the number of tokens that can be purchased with the amount of Ether sent with the transaction, and updates the total supply and the sender's balance accordingly. Finally, the `purchaseProduct` function allows for the purchase of a product with tokens, updating balances, total supply, product limits, and allowances as needed.",
