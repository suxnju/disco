The receive function implements the logic described in the problem. It first checks if the sender has a non-zero invested amount, then it calculates the reward. If the reward is greater than 0, it transfers the reward to the sender and subtracts it from the raised amount. If the raised amount divided by 10 is greater than 0, it transfers 10% of the raised amount to the sender and subtracts it from the raised amount. Finally, it updates the raised, investblock, and invested variables.",
