				"content": "Sure, here is a Solidity contract that implements the above logic:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract BountyContract {\n    \n    uint256 public owner;\n    uint256 public x1;\n    uint256 public x2;\n    uint256 public x3;\n    uint256 public x4;\n    uint256 public bestsolution;\n    uint256 public addressofwinner;\n    uint256 public durationinblocks;\n    uint256 public competitionend;\n    uint256 public claimperiodelength;\n    \n    function claimBounty() public {\n        require(block.number > competitionend, \"The competition is not yet over\");\n        \n        if (block.number + durationinblocks >= block.number) {\n            if (addressofwinner == 0) {\n                competitionend = block.number + durationinblocks;\n            } else if (block.number < competitionend + claimperiodelength && \n                       competitionend + claimperiodelength >= competitionend) {\n                          \n                competitionend = block.number + durationinblocks;\n                address payable winner = address(uint160(addressofwinner));\n                require(winner.send(address(this).balance), \"Transfer failed\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    function extendCompetition() public {\n        require(block.number + durationinblocks >= block.number && \n                competitionend + claimperiodelength >= competitionend && \n                addressofwinner == 0 && \n                block.number > competitionend + claimperiodelength, \"Cannot extend competition\");\n                \n        competitionend = block.number + durationinblocks;\n        addressofwinner = 0;\n    }\n    \n    fallback() external payable {\n        msg.sender.transfer(msg.value);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note, you should not use uint256 for addresses. I have used it here because it was in the specification. However, this is not good practice. Ethereum addresses should be stored as address type. Additionally, the contract does not use safemath for arithmetic operations and does not check for overflows/underflows which is also not a good practice. \n\nThis contract also does not take into account the owner of the contract and does not have any access control for the `claimBounty` and `extendCompetition` functions. You might want to add this in a real-world contract.",
