				"content": "The decompiled code provided is quite simple and doesn't have much functionality, but based on it, the Solidity contract could look like this:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Contract {\n    function main() public view {\n        require(msg.data.length >= 4, \"Data length must be at least 4\");\n        assembly {\n            mstore(0x40, 0x80)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this contract might not act exactly as the original bytecode intended. It's because Solidity is a high-level language and has many abstractions; while EVM bytecode is a low-level representation and can include some operations or optimizations that are not obvious or don't have direct equivalents in Solidity. Also, the `stop()` operation in the bytecode is handled in Solidity with `require()`, which throws an exception if its condition is not met.",
