				"content": "Here is the Solidity smart contract equivalent to your decompiled code:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size is too large\");\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Calldata size must be zero\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFew points to note:\n\n1. The `fallback` function is a function that is executed if the function signature does not match any of the available functions in a Solidity contract. It's also executed if no data is sent with the transaction and non-ether is sent.\n\n2. The `msg.data` variable contains the data of the called function in Ethereum. It's similar to the `calldata` in the decompiled code.\n\n3. The `require` function is used to ensure valid conditions that cannot be detected until execution time. This function checks the expression in it, and if the expression returns `false`, it reverts the transaction. If the condition is `true`, the function continues to execute.\n\n4. The `msg.data.length < 4` and `msg.data.length == 0` conditions are contradictory, because no `msg.data.length` can satisfy both conditions at the same time. You may want to revise the conditions according to your actual requirements.",
