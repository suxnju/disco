It also includes two transfer functions that checks if the contract is paused or not and transfers the ether received to either the caller or the provided address. The `require()` function is used to ensure that the receiving address is not empty and that the transfer is successful. The `.call()` function is used for external calls instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.",
