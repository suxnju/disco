				"content": "Based on the decompiled code, the Solidity contract code could be as follows:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract TransferContract {\n    bool private _transfer;\n\n    function transfer(address payable recipient) public payable {\n        if (!_transfer) {\n            (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n        } else {\n            (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    function classicTransfer(address payable recipient) public payable {\n        if (_transfer) {\n            (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n        } else {\n            (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    function switchTransferMode() public {\n        _transfer = !_transfer;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis Solidity contract includes two functions: `transfer` and `classicTransfer`. According to the conditions in these functions, the `transfer` function sends ether from the contract to the recipient address if `_transfer` is `false`, or to the sender if `_transfer` is `true`. The `classicTransfer` function does the opposite.\n\nThe `__function_selector__` function is not standard in Solidity and seems to be an artefact of possible reverse-engineering or decompilation. In Solidity, function selection is done automatically based on the function signature and arguments, not manually by the developer.\n\nThe `switchTransferMode` function is added to switch the `_transfer` mode between `true` and `false`.\n\nNote: This Solidity contract assumes that `_transfer` is a boolean variable, as the decompiled code uses it in an if-statement, which in Solidity only works with boolean expressions.",
