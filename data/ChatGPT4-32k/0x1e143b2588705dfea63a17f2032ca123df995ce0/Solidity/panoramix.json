				"content": "Based on the decompiled code in your question, the corresponding Solidity smart contract could look like this:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    uint8 stor0;\n\n    function() external payable {\n        revert();\n    }\n\n    function classicTransfer(address payable _to) public payable {\n        if (stor0 != 0) {\n            _to.transfer(msg.value);\n        } else {\n            msg.sender.transfer(msg.value);\n        }\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address payable _addr) public payable {\n        if (stor0 == 0) {\n            _addr.transfer(msg.value);\n        } else {\n            msg.sender.transfer(msg.value);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that in Solidity, `call`, `delegatecall` and `callcode` are low-level functions and should be avoided if possible. `transfer` is recommended when transferring Ether because it reverts on failure. Also, these methods do not take gas limits as parameters. The gas stipend for `transfer` is fixed at 2300 gas, which is only enough for logging an event. \n\nIn addition, in Ethereum, the fallback function is the function that gets executed if no other function matches the function identifier in the transaction data, or if no data was supplied at all. The fallback function has to be marked `external` and it can't have arguments. In this contract, it reverts any transactions sent to it.",
