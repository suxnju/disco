The `deposit` function is marked as `payable` so it can accept and store Ether. We have also used the `require` function to ensure conditions are met before executing operations. The `msg.sender` is used to validate the owner of the contract, and `msg.value` is used to handle the amount of Ether sent to the contract.",
