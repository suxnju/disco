You need to replace the comment `// call external contract here` with the actual function call.\n\nThe contract uses the ERC20 interface to interact with other contracts. ERC20 is a standard interface for tokens. The interface is used in the `getTokenBalance` and `collectOtherTokens` functions to call the `balanceOf` and `transfer` functions of other contracts.\n\nThe contract does not check for overflows and underflows because Solidity 0.8.0 and later automatically checks for these conditions. If you use a version earlier than 0.8.0, you need to use the SafeMath library to prevent overflows and underflows.\n\nThe contract does not check if the callee address is empty before transferring Ether because the `transfer` function automatically throws an exception if the callee is the zero address. If you use the `send` or `call` functions to transfer Ether, you need to check if the callee is the zero address.",
