				"content": "Here is the contract code following your description:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    mapping(address => uint256) private balanceOf;\n    mapping(address => uint256) private balanceOf1;\n\n    receive() external payable {\n        address sender = msg.sender;\n        require(sender != address(0), \"Cannot be zero address\");\n        balanceOf1[sender] = block.number;\n        balanceOf[sender] += msg.value;\n        if (balanceOf[sender] != 0) {\n            uint256 amount = ((((10 * balanceOf[sender]) / 100) * \n            (block.number - balanceOf1[sender])) / 6000);\n            require(balanceOf[sender] >= amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n            balanceOf[sender] -= amount;\n            (bool success, ) = sender.call{value: amount}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, we have a `receive` fallback function that is payable and updates the `balanceOf` and `balanceOf1` mappings for the sender. If the `balanceOf` mapping for the sender is not `0`, it calculates an `amount` using the formula you provided and transfers that `amount` to the sender.\n\nNote: This code does not check for underflows or overflows in the arithmetic operations. You may want to use the `SafeMath` library (or the built-in overflow/underflow protection in Solidity 0.8.0 and later) to protect against this. However, this would require importing an external resource, which you specified should not be done.",
