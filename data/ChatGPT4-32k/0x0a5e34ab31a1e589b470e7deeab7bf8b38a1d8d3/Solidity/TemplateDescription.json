If the ABI of the `token` contract is known, it's recommended to include the interface of the `token` contract in the code and interact with it using high-level calls.\n\nAlso, the contract doesn't use SafeMath for arithmetic operations which can prevent overflow and underflow attacks. The contract can be made safer by using the SafeMath library for all arithmetic operations.",
