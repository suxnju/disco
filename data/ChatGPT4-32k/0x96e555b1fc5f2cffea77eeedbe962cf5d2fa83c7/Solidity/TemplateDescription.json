There are two functions for contributing to the red and blue teams respectively, and a fallback function which contributes to the red or blue team based on whether the sent ether is even or odd. Finally, there is a function for the beneficiary to claim the donation. Safety checks are included to ensure no underflows or overflows occur during arithmetic operations, and that transfers only occur when there are sufficient funds.",
