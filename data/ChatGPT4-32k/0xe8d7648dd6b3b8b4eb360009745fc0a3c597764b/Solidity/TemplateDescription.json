				"content": "Here is the contract code as per your description:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 public value;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        value = 0;\n    }\n\n    function increment() public payable {\n        require(value + 1 > value, \"SafeMath: addition overflow\");\n        value = value + 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a public state variable `value` of type `uint256`. The constructor is payable and sets the `value` to 0. The `increment` function is also payable and increments the `value` by 1. \n\nPlease note that the Solidity compiler version is locked to 0.6.12 as per your instruction. \n\nAlso, note that the `increment` function uses the SafeMath approach to prevent overflow. Before adding 1 to the `value`, it checks if the result would be larger than the current `value`, which should always be the case unless there was an overflow. If there is an overflow, the transaction is reverted with an error message.\n\nThe contract does not use external calls, so there is no use of `.call()`, `.transfer()`, or `.send()`. The contract does not receive or send Ether (apart from the payable constructor and increment function), so there is no need to check if an address is empty before sending Ether. \n\nFinally, the contract does not make use of the built-in functions and properties you mentioned (`abi.encodePacked(...)`, `keccak256(bytes memory)`, `sha256(bytes memory)`, `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `blockhash(uint blockNumber)`) or the constant `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`, as they are not necessary for the contract logic you described.",
