				"content": "Here's the equivalent Solidity code for the given bytecode:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Contract {\n    function main() public {\n        assembly {\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\n            calldatacopy(ptr, 0, 0x60)\n            \n            if lt(calldatasize(), 4) {\n                if iszero(calldatasize()) { \n                    revert(0, 0) \n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract has a `main` function that uses inline assembly to perform some low-level operations. The `assembly` block allows to write assembly language in Solidity. \n\nThis code checks if the size of `calldata` (the data passed to the contract) is less than 4. If this is the case and `calldata` size is zero, it reverts the transaction. The `0x40` is a special slot in memory where Solidity compiler keeps the current top of the memory. \n\nThe provided decompiled code suggests that unhandled terminations are not taken into account in the original contract. Therefore, there is no additional handling for these cases (when `calldata` size is 4 or more) in the Solidity version. \n\nPlease note that this code is very low-level and it's not common to see such code in Solidity contracts. It's more common to use high-level Solidity code that doesn't require manually handling the memory.",
