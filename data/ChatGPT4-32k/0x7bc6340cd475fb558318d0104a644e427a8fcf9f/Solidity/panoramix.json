The function is marked payable, so it can receive Ether together with the call.\n\nThe `require` statements in the fallback function are used to check the conditions on the calldata size. If these conditions are not met, the function call will fail and all the changes will be reverted. \n\nHowever, please also note that these two conditions are contradictory and can't be satisfied at the same time: it can't be less than 4 and zero at the same time. This is just a direct translation of the given decompiled code.",
