It uses mappings for `s_12` to assign different values to different addresses. It uses arrays to add values to `s_0`, `s_1`, and `s_16`. \n\nThe contract is simple and doesn't include any functions beyond the constructor, as there was no additional functionality described. Also, I kept in mind the provided programming specifications while writing this contract.",
