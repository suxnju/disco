The `receive` function is a fallback function that is triggered when the contract is sent Ether. If the conditions are met, it calls the `userRollDice` function of the `etherwow` contract with the received Ether as value. The `ownerSetMod` and `ownerSetEtherwowAddress` functions allow the owner to set the `bet` variable and the `etherwow` contract address, respectively. Note that the address of the `etherwow` contract must be payable since we're sending Ether to it.",
