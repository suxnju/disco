If the amount is set to 0, it withdraws all Ether. Another function `withdrawAllFunds` allows the owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract. Both functions use the `.call()` function to transfer Ether to the recipient. The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner can call these functions.",
