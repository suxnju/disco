`sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  -

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
