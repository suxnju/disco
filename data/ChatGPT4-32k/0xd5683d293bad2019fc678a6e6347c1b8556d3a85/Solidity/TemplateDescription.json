				"content": "Here is a Solidity contract based on the provided description. Please note, the provided description is quite complex and might not align with the best practices for writing a smart contract. Due to the complexity of the provided description, the contract might require further optimization and testing.\n\nThe SHA3 function in Solidity has been replaced by keccak256, so I have used keccak256 in the contract. Also, the \"_totalsupply\" variable is updated based on the logic provided, but it's not used anywhere else in the contract. The logic for updating \"totalSupply\" and \"totalSupply1\" seems to be repeating, so it's written once and used in all necessary places.\n\nThe contract doesn't implement a standard ERC20 interface, so it might not be compatible with other contracts or wallets expecting a standard token contract.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address public owner;\n    address public newowner;\n    string public symbol;\n    string public name;\n    uint8 public decimals;\n    uint256 public _totalsupply;\n    uint256 private totalSupply1;\n    uint256 private totalSupply;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceof;\n    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowance;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        symbol = \"0\";\n        totalSupply = 0;\n        totalSupply1 = 0x186a0;\n\n        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked((31 + (bytes(symbol).length / 2)) / 32)) <= keccak256(abi.encodePacked(uint(2)))) {\n            name = \"0\";\n            decimals = 18;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function approve(address _to, uint256 _value) public {\n        allowance[msg.sender][_to] = _value;\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        if (totalSupply < totalSupply1) {\n            totalSupply += 1;\n            balanceof[msg.sender] += 0x2b5e3af16b1880000;\n            balanceof[owner] += 0x1bc16d674ec80000;\n            _totalsupply += 0x2beab3e28a9201800;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function acceptOwnership() public {\n        require(msg.sender == newowner, \"Only the new owner can call this function\");\n        owner = newowner;\n        newowner = address(0);\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newowner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can call this function\");\n        newowner = _newowner;\n    }\n\n    function transferAnyERC20Token(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _value) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can call this function\");\n        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner, _value);\n    }\n\n    function approveAndCall(address _spender, uint256 _value, bytes memory _extraData) public {\n        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;\n        if (_extraData.length > 0) {\n            IApprovalReceiver(_spender).receiveApproval(msg.sender, _value, _extraData);\n        }\n    }\n\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public {\n        require(balanceof[_from] >= _value, \"Not enough balance\");\n        require(allowance[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, \"Not enough allowance\");\n        balanceof[_from] -= _value;\n        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceof[_to] += (_value * 98) / 100;\n        _totalsupply -= _value - ((_value * 98) / 100);\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {\n        require(balanceof[msg.sender] >= _value, \"Not enough balance\");\n        balanceof[msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceof[_to] += (_value * 98) / 100;\n        _totalsupply -= _value - ((_value * 98) / 100);\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IERC20 {\n    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\n}\n\ninterface IApprovalReceiver {\n    function receiveApproval(address _from, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _extraData) external;\n}\n```\nThis contract is a starting point and will likely need further modifications and testing to fully meet your requirements. It's also important to remember that the contract should be thoroughly tested before deploying it to a live network.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
