Some state variables and programming specifications are provided to help you develop. The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable beneficiary will be updated to 0x8399a0673487150f7C5D22b88546EC991814aB03.\n- the external contract token will be updated to 0xC257bF0a9D24A62a12898dcdeD755196D20FAc17.\n- the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0xd529ae9e86000.\n- the state variable deadline will be updated to 0x5a84cd80.\n- goalinethers will be updated to 0x3635c9adc5dea00000.\n- the state variable amountraised will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable crowdsaleclosed will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable goalreached will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the recalcFlags function.\n- After deadline:\n  - the state variable crowdsaleclosed will be updated to 1.\n- When amountraised is not smaller than goalinethers:\n  - the state variable goalreached will be updated to 1.\n  - Before deadline:\n    - the state variable goalreached will be updated to 1.\n- Before deadline:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 is not greater than 0:\n    - the state variable crowdsaleclosed will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the recalcTokenPrice function.\n- it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When v0 is not greater than 0x5d21dba000:\n  - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0x11c37937e08000.\n- When v0 is greater than 0x5d21dba000, and v0 is not greater than 0x1176592e000:\n  - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0xf8f96381dc000.\n\nFor the transferRemainingTokens function.\n- For beneficiary, and crowdsaleclosed is not 0:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0. Afterthat, \n    - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token with the following argument list: beneficiary, and v0.\n\nFor the transferGainedEther function.\n- When goalreached is not 0, and for beneficiary:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to beneficiary.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When crowdsaleclosed is 0, and tokenprice is not 0:\n  - When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) equals to 0:\n    - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n    - When v0 is not smaller than ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/tokenprice):\n      - the state variable amountraised will be updated to (amountraised+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - the tokenbalance of caller will be updated to (the tokenbalance of caller+((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/tokenprice)).\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token with the following argument list: caller, and ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/tokenprice).\n      - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n      - When v1 is not greater than 0x5d21dba000:\n        - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0x11c37937e08000.\n      - When v1 is greater than 0x5d21dba000, and v1 is not greater than 0x1176592e000:\n        - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0xf8f96381dc000.\n  - When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) does not equal to 0, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not 0, and ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)) equals to 0xf4240:\n    - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n    - When v0 is not smaller than ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/tokenprice):\n      - the state variable amountraised will be updated to (amountraised+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - the tokenbalance of caller will be updated to (the tokenbalance of caller+((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/tokenprice)).\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract token with the following argument list: caller, and ((the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*0xf4240)/tokenprice).\n      - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n      - When v1 is not greater than 0x5d21dba000:\n        - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0x11c37937e08000.\n      - When v1 is greater than 0x5d21dba000, and v1 is not greater than 0x1176592e000:\n        - the state variable tokenprice will be updated to 0xf8f96381dc000.\n\nFor the receiveApproval function, it has 4 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, bytes.\n- When goalreached is 0, and crowdsaleclosed is not 0, and the tokenbalance of the first argument equals to the second argument, and the external contract token equals to the third argument:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the balance of the first argument is greater than 0, and the tokenbalance of the first argument equals to v0:\n    - it calls an external function transferFrom of the external contract token, and gets the returned value as v1. Afterthat, \n      - it calls an external function 0x000000v1 of the first argument with ether valued valued the balance of the first argument\n      - the balance of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n      - the tokenbalance of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `beneficiary` is typed address,public state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `tokenprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `deadline` is typed uint256,public state variable `goalinethers` is typed uint256,public state variable `amountraised` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `tokenbalanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `goalreached` is typed bool,public state variable `crowdsaleclosed` is typed bool.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
