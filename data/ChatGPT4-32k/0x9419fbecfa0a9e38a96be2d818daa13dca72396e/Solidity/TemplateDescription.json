It has a constructor, 'order', 'withdraw', 'changeTradeState', 'cancelOrder', 'transferOwnership', 'systemMessage', 'depositToken', 'withdrawToken', and 'deposit' functions. The contract uses `keccak256` and `abi.encodePacked` for hashing and encoding. It also checks the conditions before executing the operations to avoid any possible errors or vulnerabilities. The contract also uses `call` instead of `transfer` or `send` for external calls.",
