the state variable locked will be updated to 0.\n  When locked is 0, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract token is greater than 0, and v1 is greater than 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract tokenReward is greater than 0, and (current time+0x15180) is not smaller than current time, and the address of this contract does not equal to the element in the coins is greater than 0:\n  - it delegates a call to the element in the coins with arguments: 0x70a08231,the address of this contract. Afterthat, \n    - it calls an external function YmCvE of the element in the coins with the following argument list: token2, and v2.\n  When locked is 0, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract token is greater than 0, and v1 is greater than 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract tokenReward is greater than 0, and (current time+0x15180) is not smaller than current time, and the address of this contract does not equal to the element in the coins is greater than 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the element in the coins with index 1 is greater than 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract token1 is greater than 0, and v3 is greater than 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract token2 is greater than 0:\n  - it delegates a call to the external contract token2 with arguments: 0xed8e84f3,v2,v2,1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `tokenReward` is typed address,private state variable `token2` is typed address,private state variable `token` is typed address,private state variable `token1` is typed address,public state variable `coins` is typed array,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
