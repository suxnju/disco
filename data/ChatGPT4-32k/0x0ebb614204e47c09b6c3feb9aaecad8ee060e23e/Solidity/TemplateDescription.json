Afterthat, \n    - the payments of caller will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When paused is 0, and the second argument does not equal to 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n  - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the pause function.\n- When paused is 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable paused will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the asyncSend function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - the payments of the first argument will be updated to (the payments of the first argument+the second argument).\n  - the state variable totalpayments will be updated to (totalpayments+the second argument).\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the increaseApproval function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When paused is 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the allowance from caller to the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and paused is 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalpayments` is typed uint256,public state variable `payments` is typed mapping,public state variable `paused` is typed bool,private state variable `totalSupply2` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
