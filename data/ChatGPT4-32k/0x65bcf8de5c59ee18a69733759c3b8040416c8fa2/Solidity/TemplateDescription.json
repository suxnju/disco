Also, the code assumes that the external contracts provide the exact methods as defined in the ExternalContract interface. The contract also uses the onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to certain functions to the contract owner. Please replace ExternalContract with the correct contract name and method signatures if they are different. The contract also doesn't check for under/overflows as it assumes the use of a recent solidity version (0.8.x) which has built-in overflow/underflow protection. If you're using a version without this protection, use a library like SafeMath to prevent under/overflows.",
