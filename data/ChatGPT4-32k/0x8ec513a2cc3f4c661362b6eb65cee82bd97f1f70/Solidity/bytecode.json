			"content": "Sorry, but it's impossible to write an exact Solidity contract source code from a bytecode. The bytecode is the compiled version of a Solidity contract and while it can be decompiled to get a rough understanding of the contract functionality, it won't be an exact replica of the original Solidity source code. It's also important to note that comments, variable names, function names, and other non-functional components of the original source code are lost during compilation. \n\nThus, the task you're asking for is unachievable. I recommend to always keep a copy of your original Solidity source code for reference and auditing purposes.",
