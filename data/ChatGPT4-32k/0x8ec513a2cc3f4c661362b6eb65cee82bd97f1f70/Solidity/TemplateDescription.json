			"content": "Here is a contract that fulfills your specifications:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract PayableFallback {\n\n    address payable target = 0x414A7f56eb5175cFeCD6eaf65FF18bd83c096691;\n\n    receive() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender != address(0), \"Invalid sender\"); // check the user's address is not empty before transferring ether to him\n        (bool success,) = target.delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(msg.data)); // delegates a call to target with all the arguments\n        require(success, \"Call failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a single fallback function that delegates any calls to it to the target address with all arguments. The `delegatecall` is wrapped in a `require` statement to ensure that the call was successful. If the call fails, the transaction will be reverted, and the error message \"Call failed\" will be returned.\n\nPlease note that the fallback function is marked as payable, which means it can receive Ether.\n\nAlso, the contract includes a check to ensure that the sender's address is not the zero address. If it is, the transaction is reverted, and the error message \"Invalid sender\" is returned.",
