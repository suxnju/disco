Some functions like `receiveApproval` and `buyTokens` are omitted. You would need to add all the required logic to make it work as expected.\n\nAdditionally, this contract doesn't check for overflow or underflow in arithmetic operations and doesn't validate user's address before transferring ether. You should add these checks to improve security. \n\nAlso, please replace `token` address with the correct address of your token contract.\n\nFor more complex logic, you would need to create a custom contract that implements the required interface and call its methods from this contract.",
