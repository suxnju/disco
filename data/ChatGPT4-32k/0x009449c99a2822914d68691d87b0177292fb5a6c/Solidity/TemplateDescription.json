The `constructor` function is called when the contract is first created and it sets the `admin` as the account that deploys the contract. \n\nThere are two functions: `changeWallet` and `removeContract`. The `changeWallet` function can only be called by the `admin`, and it changes the `wallet` state variable to a new address provided as a parameter. Before changing, it checks that the new address is not the zero address. The `removeContract` function can also only be called by the `admin`, and it destroys the contract and sends the remaining balance to the wallet. \n\nI have used a `modifier` called `onlyAdmin` to restrict access to these two functions to only the `admin` account. If a non-admin account tries to call these functions, the transaction will be reverted.",
