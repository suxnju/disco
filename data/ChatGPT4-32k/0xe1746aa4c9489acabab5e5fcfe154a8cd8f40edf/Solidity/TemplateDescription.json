You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

For v1, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - the orderfills from caller to v0 will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the availableVolume function, it has 10 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n- it statically calls an external function fallback of 0x2 with the following argument list: 12 V94@0x1713@0x16e8 8, 24 V51@0x64e@0x63b 8, 4 V58@0x65c@0x63b 28, 4 V61@0x662@0x63b 28, and 0 or 4 V64@0x668@0x63b 28 and 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00000000, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds, and the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0:\n  - it statically calls an external function 0x00A3(194 of 0x1 with the following argument list: the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\nFor the testTrade function, it has 12 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32, uint256, address.\n- When the 11-th argument is not greater than the tokens from the first argument to the 12-th argument:\n  - it statically calls an external function fallback of 0x2 with the following argument list: 12 V120@0x1713@0x16e8 8, 24 V51@0x448@0x435 8, 4 V58@0x456@0x435 28, 4 V61@0x45c@0x435 28, and 0 or 4 V64@0x462@0x435 28 and 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00000000, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it statically calls an external function 0x00A3(194 of 0x1 with the following argument list: the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `admin` is typed address,public state variable `feeaccount` is typed address,public state variable `feetake` is typed uint256,private state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `tokens` is typed mapping,public state variable `orders` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
