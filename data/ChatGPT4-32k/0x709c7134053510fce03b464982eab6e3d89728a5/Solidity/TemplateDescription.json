You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the s_8 from the first argument to 1 will be updated to (1+(the second argument+the second argument)).\n  When the first argument is smaller than 10000, and the second argument is smaller than 5001, and (SHA3((1+SHA3(the first argument,8)))+((31+(the s_8 from the first argument to 1/2))/32)) is greater than SHA3((1+SHA3(the first argument,8))), and for the s_8 of the first argument, and the first argument is not smaller than 0:\n  - the s_8 of the address will be updated to 0.\n  When the first argument is smaller than 10000, and the second argument is smaller than 5001, and 31 is smaller than the second argument, and the second argument is greater than 0, and (128+the second argument) is greater than 128, and for the s_8 of the first argument, and the first argument is not smaller than 0:\n  - the s_8 of the address will be updated to (36+the second argument) CALLDATACOPY@0x401 32.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `latestprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `noshares` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_2` is typed uint256,public state variable `balances` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_4` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_5` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_6` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_7_12_32` is typed address,private state variable `s_8` is typed mapping,public state variable `provisionbalance` is typed mapping,private state variable `s_10` is typed array.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
