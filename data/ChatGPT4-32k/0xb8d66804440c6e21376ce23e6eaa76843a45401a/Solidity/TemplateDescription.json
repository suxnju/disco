It includes a constructor and three functions: claimReferrerBonus, sell, and transfer. The contract contains several public state variables and uses the SafeMath library to prevent arithmetic overflow and underflow. Note that this is a simplified version of the contract and may require additional functions and safety checks for a real-world application.",
