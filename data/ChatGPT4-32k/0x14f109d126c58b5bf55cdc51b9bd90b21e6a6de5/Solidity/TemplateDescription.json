The contract is initialized with a total supply of tokens, which is distributed to the owner of the contract. \nUsers can buy tokens from the owner with Ether, sell their tokens back to the contract in exchange for Ether, transfer their tokens to other users, and approve other users to spend their tokens on their behalf. The price of the tokens is updated based on the total supply. \n\nPlease note that you need to install SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin to avoid overflow and underflow issues, and make sure external calls are done using .call() instead of .transfer() and .send().",
