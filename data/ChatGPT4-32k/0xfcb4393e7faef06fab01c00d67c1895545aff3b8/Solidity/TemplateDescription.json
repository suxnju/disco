It also includes a `burn` function, which is marked as `external` and `payable`. \n\nIn the `burn` function, it first calls the `trade` function of the `kybercontract` contract with ether valued the first argument and the specified argument list. It then decodes the returned value and assigns it to `v0`. \n\nLastly, it calls the `burn` function of the `desterc20` contract with `v0` as the argument for 8 times.\n\nPlease note that you should replace `kybercontract` and `desterc20` addresses with the actual addresses of your contracts. Also, make sure to provide enough gas for the transaction, especially when there are many external contract calls.",
