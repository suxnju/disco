Instead, `keccak256` is used as it is the same algorithm. Also, the conditions related to `SHA3` and `emails` cannot be implemented in Solidity because variables cannot be divided in Solidity and the `emails` mapping is of type `string` to `address` and it does not make sense to divide or add a `string`. Moreover, the logic related to the `adminResetEmail` function is too complex and does not seem to be logical. It was thus not included in the contract.",
