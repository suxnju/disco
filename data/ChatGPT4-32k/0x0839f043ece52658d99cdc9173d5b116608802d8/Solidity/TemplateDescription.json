Also, please replace the placeholder `// similar logic to the one in lockTKNContractAddress function` and `// similar logic to the one in claim function` with the actual logic. The contracts or methods `resolver`, `addr`, `isAdmin`, and `transferFrom` are assumed to be in the `token` contract and have the described interfaces.

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

When the call or transfer succeeds, and v0 is not 0, and tkncontractaddresslocked is 0:\n      - the state variable tkncontractaddress will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the claim function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- it statically calls an external function resolver of the external contract token with controllernode as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds:\n  - it statically calls an external function addr of v1 with controllernode as the argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it statically calls an external function isAdmin of v0 with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v0 is not 0:\n      - When the second argument is 0:\n        - it transfers ether valued the third argument to the first argument.\n      - When the second argument is not 0:\n        - it calls an external function transfer of the second argument with the following argument list: 28 V206@0x1317@0x1309 4, and 28 V43@0x331@0x316 4 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or 0.\n\nFor the payable load function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) equals to the second argument, and the first argument is 0, and tkncontractaddress does not equal to the first argument, and (licenceamountscaled+1000) is greater than 0:\n  - When 0 is not greater than the second argument, and the second argument is 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (the second argument-0) to tokenholder.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to cryptofloat.\n  - When ((1000*the second argument)/(licenceamountscaled+1000)) is not greater than the second argument, and the second argument is not 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (the second argument-((1000*the second argument)/(licenceamountscaled+1000))) to tokenholder.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued ((1000*the second argument)/(licenceamountscaled+1000)) to cryptofloat.\n- When tkncontractaddress equals to the first argument:\n  - it calls an external function transferFrom of the first argument with the following argument list: 28 V77@0xeac@0xe9d 4, 28 V80@0xeb3@0xe9d 4, and 28 V42@0x1bc@0x1ab 4 and 0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or 0.\n\nFor the updateLicenceDAO function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- it statically calls an external function resolver of the external contract token with controllernode as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds:\n  - it statically calls an external function addr of v1 with controllernode as the argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it statically calls an external function isAdmin of v0 with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n    - When licencedaolocked is 0, and v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - the state variable licencedao will be updated to the first argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `ensregistry` is typed address,public state variable `controllernode` is typed uint256,public state variable `tkncontractaddress` is typed address,public state variable `cryptofloat` is typed address,public state variable `tokenholder` is typed address,public state variable `tkncontractaddresslocked` is typed bool,public state variable `licencedaolocked` is typed bool,public state variable `holderlocked` is typed bool,public state variable `floatlocked` is typed bool,public state variable `licencedao` is typed address,public state variable `licenceamountscaled` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
