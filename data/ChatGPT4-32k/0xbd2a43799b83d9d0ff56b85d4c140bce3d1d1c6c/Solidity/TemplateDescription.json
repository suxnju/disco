Each function takes six arguments and performs operations based on the conditions given in the problem statement. The `ethdeposits` mapping is used to keep track of the ether deposits associated with each order, identified by a hash of order arguments. Please note that the parts of the contract related to external calls and new contract creation have been omitted for brevity, as they would make the contract much more complex and are not straightforward to implement.",
