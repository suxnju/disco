The total distributed is also updated.\n- In the tokenWithdraw function, the total amount of tokens that the contract owns is transferred to the specified address.\n- In the exchange function, tokens are transferred to the sender in exchange for Ether, at the specified exchange rate. The current balance and total distributed are updated.\n",
