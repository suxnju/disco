The `fallback` function receives Ether, and updates the balance of the sender based on the conditions you've provided. The `resetState` function allows the owner to update the state of a user and the `changeOwner` function allows the owner to transfer ownership. The `withdrawloss` function transfers Ether to the owner and updates the balance and state of users based on your conditions. The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw their balance, and if the transaction fails, Ether is transferred to the owner. Please note that the `report` function isn't included due to its length and complexity.",
