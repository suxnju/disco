Nonetheless, here is a basic example of a Solidity contract:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    uint256 public data;\n\n    event DataSet(uint256 _data);\n\n    function setData(uint256 _data) public {\n        data = _data;\n        emit DataSet(_data);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a public variable `data` which value can be set by calling the `setData` function. When the `data` is set, an event `DataSet` is emitted.\n\nIf you provide the decompiled code, I would be able to write a more specific contract.",
