				"content": "Based on the decompiled code provided, here is the Solidity code:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract Contract {\n    function main() public {\n        assembly {\n            mstore(0x40, 0x80)\n        \n            if lt(calldatasize, 0x04) {\n                if iszero(calldatasize) {\n                    revert(0, 0)\n                }\n            \n                // Unhandled termination\n            } else {\n                // Unhandled termination\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a single function, `main`, which uses inline assembly to interact directly with the EVM. The contract checks if the size of `calldata` (the data part of the transaction or call) is less than 4 bytes. If it is, and if the size of `calldata` is also zero, the contract will revert any changes (effectively stopping the transaction).\n\nPlease note that the \"unhandled termination\" comments suggest that the original contract might have some additional logic in these conditions that is not shown in the decompiled code. Also, please consider that working with assembly in Solidity should be done with care, as it can be more prone to errors and security vulnerabilities.",
