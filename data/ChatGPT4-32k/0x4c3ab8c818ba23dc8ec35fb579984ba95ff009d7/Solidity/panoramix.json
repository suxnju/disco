				"content": "Based on the provided decompiled code, the equivalent Solidity contract code could be:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.7.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    function () external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size is too big\");\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Calldata size is not zero\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe fallback function in the contract is called if the data sent along with the ether is either shorter than 4 bytes or is not provided. If the conditions aren't met, then the function will throw, and the transaction will fail. The error messages in the require statements provide information about the reason for the failure. \n\nPlease note that in Solidity 0.6.0 and later, the fallback function has to be declared as `fallback() external payable` and `receive() external payable` to receive Ether. The `fallback` function is triggered when the contract is called with function that does not match any of the available functions in `calldata`. The `receive` function is triggered when the call data is empty.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.7.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size is too big\");\n    }\n    receive() external payable {\n        // custom function code\n    }\n}\n```",
