All functions except the constructor are payable and they transfer a specified amount of ether to a given address. The address must not be empty and the transfer must be successful, otherwise the functions will revert. \n\nPlease note that the `shardAward`, `bigAward`, and `withdraw` functions have an unused argument (`_shard`, `_award`, and `_withdraw` respectively). If they hold any significance, you might want to integrate them into the function logic.",
