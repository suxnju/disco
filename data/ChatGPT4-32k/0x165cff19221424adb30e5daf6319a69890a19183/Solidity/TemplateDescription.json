Both functions are only callable by the `owner` of the contract and they both make external calls to the `token` contract. The `sendEther` function sends Ether to a given address, and the `sendTokens` function sends tokens from one address to another. The contract also checks that the target addresses are not the zero address, which is a common security practice in Solidity contracts.",
