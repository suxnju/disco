It also assumes that the condition for the state variable are correct and the logic described is correct. It does not include any error handling or events which would typically be included in a production contract. \n\nPlease replace `YourContract` with the actual name of your contract and remember to replace `token.call` with the actual function call to the mint and finishMinting functions on the external contract. The contract does not include all the functionality described like safemath operations, checking for address emptiness etc.",
