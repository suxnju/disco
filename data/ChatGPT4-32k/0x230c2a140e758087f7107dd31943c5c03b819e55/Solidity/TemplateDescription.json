It also includes a function for external calls (`externalCall`), a couple of functions for safe math operations (`safeAdd` and `safeSub`), a function to check some block properties (`checkBlockProperties`), a function to compute Keccak-256 and SHA-256 hashes (`computeHashes`), and a function to recover an address from a signature (`recoverAddress`).",
