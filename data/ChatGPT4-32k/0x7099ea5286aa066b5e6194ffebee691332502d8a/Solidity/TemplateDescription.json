				"content": "Sure, here's a contract that follows the requirements and specifications you've outlined:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address payable recipient1 = 0xF4c6BB681800Ffb96Bc046F56af9f06Ab5774156;\n    address payable recipient2 = 0xD79D762727A6eeb9c47Cfb6FB451C858dfBF8405;\n    address payable recipient3 = 0x83c0Efc6d8B16D87BFe1335AB6BcAb3Ed3960285;\n\n    function get() public payable {\n        require(recipient1 != address(0));\n        require(recipient2 != address(0));\n        require(recipient3 != address(0));\n        require(address(this).balance > 0);\n\n        uint256 thirdPart = address(this).balance / 3;\n\n        (bool successRecipient1, ) = recipient1.call{value: thirdPart}(\"\");\n        require(successRecipient1, \"Transfer failed.\");\n\n        (bool successRecipient2, ) = recipient2.call{value: thirdPart}(\"\");\n        require(successRecipient2, \"Transfer failed.\");\n\n        uint256 remainingBalance = address(this).balance;\n        (bool successRecipient3, ) = recipient3.call{value: remainingBalance}(\"\");\n        require(successRecipient3, \"Transfer failed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a function `get` which splits the contract's balance into thirds and sends those thirds to the designated recipient addresses. If there is any remaining balance after the transfers (due to integer division), it is sent to the third recipient. Please note that the recipient addresses must be non-zero and the contract must have a balance greater than 0 for the function to execute successfully. \n\nThis contract does not use any external libraries and does not allow for arithmetic underflows or overflows (Safemath operations). It also checks the recipient addresses to ensure they are not empty before transferring ether. Please note that the `get` function is `payable` to allow for `msg.value` to be used if necessary.",
