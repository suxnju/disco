				"content": "I'm afraid the provided decompiled code does not contain any solidity code or instructions for me to convert into a smart contract. It just mentions that the decompiler failed with \"_fallback()\". \n\nHere's an example of a simple fallback function in Solidity:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 public storedData;\n\n    function set(uint256 x) public {\n        storedData = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return storedData;\n    }\n\n    function() external {\n        storedData = 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, the function with the signature `function() external` is a fallback function. This function is called whenever someone sends Ether to the contract without providing any data, or if the data does not match any of the other function signatures.\n\nPlease provide a more detailed EVM bytecode or a more specific requirement so I can write the corresponding solidity contract.",
