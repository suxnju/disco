However, I can provide you an example of how a smart contract written in Solidity might look:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.6;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 public myNumber;\n\n    function setMyNumber(uint256 _myNumber) public {\n        myNumber = _myNumber;\n    }\n\n    function getMyNumber() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return myNumber;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a simple contract that has a state variable `myNumber` and two functions: `setMyNumber` to set the value of `myNumber` and `getMyNumber` to read the current value of `myNumber`.\n\nIf you could provide the full decompiled code, I could give you a more accurate Solidity contract.",
