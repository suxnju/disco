It gets executed if no other function matches the called function.\n    fallback() external {\n        revert(\"Function does not exist\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, any ether sent directly to the contract address will be rejected as the fallback function is not payable. Additionally, any function calls that do not match existing functions will also revert.",
