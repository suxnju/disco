				"content": "Based on the given decompiled code, the Solidity smart contract would look something like this:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.8.0;\n\ncontract SmartContract {\n    \n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size is too big\");\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Calldata size is not zero\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a fallback function which is called when the function signature does not match any of the available functions in the contract or if no data was supplied at all. It has two requirements: \n\n1. The calldata size must be less than 4, i.e., the calldata (msg.data) length must be less than 4 bytes.\n2. The calldata size must be zero, i.e., no calldata should be sent with the transaction.\n\nRemember, the provided decompiled code is quite illogical because the two requirements are contradictory. The first requirement allows for some data (less than 4 bytes), but the second requirement does not allow any data at all. Hence, in practice, this fallback function will always fail. The provided Solidity contract is just a direct translation of the provided decompiled code.",
