				"content": "Sure, I can provide a Solidity version of the given decompiled code. However, please note that this decompiled code seems to be incomplete and it's not fully clear what it's supposed to do. Also, the `stop()` function and unhandled termination conditions are not standard Solidity and their implementation is not provided. Below is a rough translation into Solidity:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Contract {\n    function main() public {\n        bytes32 mSize;\n        assembly {\n            mSize := mload(0x40)\n            mstore(mSize, 0x80)\n        }\n\n        if (msg.data.length < 4) {\n            if (msg.data.length == 0) {\n                // stop(); This is not a standard Solidity command and its implementation is not provided.\n            }\n            // Unhandled termination. This is not a standard Solidity command and its implementation is not provided.\n        } else {\n            // Unhandled termination. This is not a standard Solidity command and its implementation is not provided.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that Solidity is a high-level language and doesn't provide the same low-level control that EVM bytecode does. The `memory[0x40:0x60] = 0x80;` command seems to be setting a memory slot, which can be interpreted in Solidity using inline assembly with the `mload` and `mstore` commands.\n\nThis code has not been tested and should be reviewed before any use.",
