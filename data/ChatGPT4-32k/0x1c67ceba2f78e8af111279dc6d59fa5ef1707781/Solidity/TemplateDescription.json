The constructor initializes the contract's state variables. `placeBet` allows users to place a bet and possibly win, `changeBet` allows the contract owner to change the bet amount, and `transferOwnership` allows the owner to transfer ownership to another address. The contract also includes several state variables to keep track of the game's state, the contract's address, the contract owner, and the last winner.",
