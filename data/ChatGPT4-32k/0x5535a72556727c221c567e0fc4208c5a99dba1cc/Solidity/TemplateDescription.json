The `fallback` function handles incoming transactions and updates the `balanceOf` mapping accordingly. The `payout` function allows the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract if `currentstate == 2`. The `refund` function allows contributors to withdraw their funds if `currentstate == 3`. The `set*` functions allow the owner to change the current state of the contract.",
