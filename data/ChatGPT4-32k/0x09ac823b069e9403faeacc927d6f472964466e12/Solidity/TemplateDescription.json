Each function checks the contract state as required. The `close` function transfers all contract balance to the `wallet` address. The `enableRefunds` function changes the contract state to enable refunds. The `transferOwnership` function allows the contract owner to be changed. The `refund` function allows an address to refund their deposits when state is 1. The `deposit` function allows the contract owner to deposit ether on behalf of an address.",
