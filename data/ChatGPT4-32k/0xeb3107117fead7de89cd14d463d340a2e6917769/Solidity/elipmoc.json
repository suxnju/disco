			"content": "Based on the decompiled code, here is the solidity equivalent:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    bytes4 private constant FUNCTION_SELECTOR = 0xa619486e;\n\n    function externalCall(bytes4 functionSelector, address target, bytes memory data) public payable returns (bytes memory) {\n        require(functionSelector != FUNCTION_SELECTOR, \"Invalid function selector\");\n\n        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = target.delegatecall(data);\n\n        require(success, \"Delegatecall failed\");\n\n        return returnData;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract contains a function `externalCall` that accepts a function selector, a target address, and data. It then performs a `delegatecall` to the target address with the given data. It requires that the function selector is not equal to a certain constant value. The function will return the data returned from the `delegatecall`.\n\nPlease note that the use of `delegatecall` can make a contract vulnerable if it's used improperly. It allows another contract to execute code within its context, including modifying its state variables. Therefore, make sure to use it carefully.\n\nAlso, the exact behavior of the original code might not be perfectly mirrored due to some properties that cannot be directly translated into solidity, like the dynamic gas allocation for the delegate call, or the direct memory handling.",
