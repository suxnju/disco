The `setFallbackAddress` function allows you to set the `fallback` address. It checks that the address is not null before setting it.\n\nThe fallback function is payable and checks that the data it receives is not null. It decodes the data into a `bytes32` type and compares it with the specified constant. If they are not equal, it delegates the call to the fallback address with the same function signature and data. It checks that the delegate call was successful. If not, it reverts the transaction.  \n\nPlease note that the comparison is done against a constant value. If you want to change it, you need to update the `constantVal` inside the fallback function.",
