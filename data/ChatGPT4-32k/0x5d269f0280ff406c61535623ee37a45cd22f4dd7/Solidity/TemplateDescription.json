The contract also includes functions to approve spending, transfer funds, and manage an auction process. The contract prevents reentrancy attacks by updating state before making external calls. It also uses `call` instead of `transfer` or `send` to forward ether, as recommended for contracts targeting Solidity 0.6.12 and beyond.",
