I assumed that `totalSupply` and `hodlers[msg.sender]` are initially zero.\n2. The `party` function requires the caller to have a non-zero balance in `hodlers`.\n3. `withdrawForeignTokens` first retrieves the balance of this contract in the foreign token contract, then transfers 1% of this balance to the specified recipient.\n4. Due to the use of `.call()`, exceptions in the external contract will not cause this contract to revert. Instead, the return values need to be checked for any errors.\n5. This contract does not prevent re-entrancy attacks. Please consider using a re-entrancy guard if the external contract's `transfer` function can call back into this contract.\n6. The contract does not enforce a maximum `totalSupply`. Please consider adding a cap if necessary.\n7. This contract does not handle underflows or overflows. Consider using SafeMath or similar libraries to handle arithmetic operations safely.\n8. This contract does not check if the user's address is empty before transferring ether. Please add this check if necessary.",
