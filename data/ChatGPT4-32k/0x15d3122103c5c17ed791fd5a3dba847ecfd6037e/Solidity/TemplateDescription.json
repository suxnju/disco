Each time the `message` is updated, the fee is doubled.\n- Ensures that the new message does not exceed a maximum length defined by the `maxlength` state variable.\n- Checks that each transaction sender is the owner of the contract before executing `transferOwnership` and `withdraw` functions.\n- Checks that the recipient addresses for `transferOwnership` and `withdraw` functions are not zero.\n- Checks that the contract has enough balance before executing the `withdraw` function.\n- Checks that the `setMessage` function is called with enough Ether and a message of valid length.\n\nNote that this contract does not import external libraries such as SafeMath for checking underflows and overflows and does not use built-in functions such as `abi.encodePacked()`, `keccak256()`, `sha256()`, `ecrecover()`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, and `blockhash()` as they are not required according to the logic you've described.",
