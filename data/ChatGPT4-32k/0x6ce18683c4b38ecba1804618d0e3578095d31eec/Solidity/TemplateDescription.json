The `setOwner` function allows changing the owner only to a non-zero address. The `withdraw` and `withdrawAll` functions allow the owner to withdraw some or all the Ether from the contract. The `purchase` function first checks if the contract has enough balance and if the caller provided enough Ether, then makes an external call to the `purchaseFor` function of the `token` contract. If the external call fails, it reverts the transaction. All functions that change the contract state are public and the `purchase` function is payable to accept Ether.",
