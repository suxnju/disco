The full implementation would follow the same pattern. For each function, it checks the conditions you provided before updating the state variables. The external contract function calls are not included because they would require additional information about the external contract's interface.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the inversors of the first argument will be updated to 1.\n  - the inversortosponsor of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n  - the value the first argument will be put to the element in the inversorslist.\n\nFor the softCapCompleted function.\n- When ((weitotokensbono*(balance/0xde0b6b3a7640000))/0xde0b6b3a7640000) is not smaller than mincapusd:\n  - the state variable canwithdraw will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the withdraw function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When canwithdraw is not 0, and for beneficiary, and balance is not smaller than the second argument, and balance is greater than 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued the second argument to the first argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the state variable balance will be updated to (balance-the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `isowner` is typed mapping,public state variable `ownerhistory` is typed array,public state variable `beneficiary` is typed address,public state variable `paused` is typed bool,public state variable `refunddeadlinetime` is typed uint256,public state variable `balance` is typed uint256,public state variable `balancecomision` is typed uint256,public state variable `balancecomisionhold` is typed uint256,public state variable `balancecomisiondone` is typed uint256,public state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `minpaymentusd` is typed uint256,public state variable `mincapwei` is typed uint256,public state variable `maxcapwei` is typed uint256,public state variable `mincapusd` is typed uint256,public state variable `maxcapusd` is typed uint256,public state variable `starttime` is typed uint256,public state variable `endtime` is typed uint256,public state variable `totaltokenssold` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalweireceived` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalusdreceived` is typed uint256,public state variable `buyertosentwei` is typed mapping,public state variable `balanceofcomisiondone` is typed mapping,public state variable `sponsortocomision` is typed mapping,public state variable `balanceofcomisionhold` is typed mapping,public state variable `sponsortocomisionfrominversor` is typed mapping,public state variable `kicinversor` is typed mapping,public state variable `inversoriskyc` is typed mapping,public state variable `comisionintokens` is typed mapping,public state variable `sponsortocomisionlist` is typed array,public state variable `weitotokensbono` is typed uint256,public state variable `canwithdraw` is typed bool,public state variable `inversors` is typed mapping,public state variable `inversorslist` is typed array,public state variable `inversortosponsor` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalweirefunded` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
