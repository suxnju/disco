				"content": "Sure, here is a simplified Solidity contract based on the provided description. Please note that due to the complexity of the logic provided, some assumptions have been made. The code does not cover the full logic provided but serves as a starting point for further development.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ninterface IToken {\n    function delegatecall(bytes memory data) external returns (bool);\n    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\n}\n\ncontract LiquidityContract {\n    uint256 public locked;\n    address public token;\n    uint256[3] public amounts;\n    uint256[3] public amounts1;\n    uint256 public v0;\n    uint256 public v1;\n    uint256 public totalSupply1;\n    uint256 public totalSupply2;\n\n    constructor(address _token) public {\n        token = _token;\n    }\n\n    function remove_liquidity(uint256 argument1, uint256[3] memory argument2) public payable {\n        require(locked == 0, \"Already locked\");\n        locked = 1;\n        if (msg.value == 0 && address(this) != token) {\n            IToken(token).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x18160ddd));\n        }\n        // Other conditions and logic omitted for brevity\n        locked = 0;\n    }\n\n    function add_liquidity(uint256[3] memory argument1, uint256 argument2) public payable {\n        require(locked == 0, \"Already locked\");\n        locked = 1;\n        if (msg.value == 0 && totalSupply1 == 0 && totalSupply2 * 3 / totalSupply2 == 3 && address(this) != token) {\n            IToken(token).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x18160ddd));\n        }\n        // Other conditions and logic omitted for brevity\n        locked = 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract includes two main functions `remove_liquidity` and `add_liquidity`. Both functions check that the contract is not locked before proceeding. The `remove_liquidity` function also checks if the contract has received ether and if the contract address is different from the token address before making a delegated call to the token contract. Similarly, the `add_liquidity` function has some checks before making the delegated call. This contract uses an interface `IToken` to interact with the external token contract. The actual business logic within the two functions based on the provided conditions has been omitted for brevity and would need to be filled in based on the specific requirements.",
