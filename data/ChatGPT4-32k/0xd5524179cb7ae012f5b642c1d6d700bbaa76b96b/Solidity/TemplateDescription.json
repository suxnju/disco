The `setController` function is used to update the `controller` state variable. This function can only be called by the current controller.\n\nThe payable fallback function is used to receive ether. If `controllerlookupname` is not zero, it calls the `externalFunction` of the external contract and uses the returned value to delegate a call.\n\nPlease replace `IExternalContract` and `externalFunction` with the actual contract interface and function.",
