For a real-world application, you may need to handle exceptions and errors more carefully. Also, the `call` method is used instead of `transfer` or `send` to make external calls. This is because `call` allows for greater gas limit, but it also opens up the possibility for re-entrancy attacks. Therefore, re-entrancy guards should be used in production contracts where `call` is used.",
