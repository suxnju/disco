The `transferEther` function allows the `owner1` to transfer ether from the contract to another address. The `getBlockDetails` function returns details about the current block. The `encodeData` function uses `abi.encodePacked`, `keccak256`, and `sha256` to hash a string input. The `recoverAddress` function uses `ecrecover` to recover an address from a signature. The contract also includes a fallback function to accept ether.",
