				"content": "Here is the contract code that fulfills the given requirements:\n\n```sol\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address private targetAddress = 0x391a04311E0BFC913ef6fa784773307C826104F0;\n    \n    receive() external payable {\n        targetAddress.call{value: msg.value}(\"\");\n    }\n    \n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(targetAddress != address(0), \"Target address cannot be 0\");\n        (bool success,) = targetAddress.delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(msg.data));\n        require(success, \"Delegatecall failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a fallback function that is `payable` and delegates a call to `targetAddress` with the same call data. If the `delegatecall` fails, it will revert the transaction. Note that this contract does not perform any checks for arithmetic overflows or underflows as no arithmetic operations are performed in this contract. The contract also does not use keccak256, sha256, ecrecover, block.number, block.timestamp, or blockhash as these are not required as per the provided description. \n\nPlease note that using `delegatecall` in this way is potentially unsafe, as it could make the contract vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks. Be sure to understand the security implications before using this in a production environment.",
