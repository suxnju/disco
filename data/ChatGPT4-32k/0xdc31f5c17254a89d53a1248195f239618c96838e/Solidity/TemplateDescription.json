For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the value (the element in the amounts with index 3-((the element in the amounts with index 3*the first argument)/v0)) will be put to the element in the amounts.\n  When locked is 0, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract token is greater than 0, and ((the element in the amounts*the first argument)/the element in the amounts) equals to the first argument or the element in the amounts is 0 is greater than 0, and v0 is greater than 0, and ((the element in the amounts*the first argument)/v0) is not smaller than the second argument, and the element in the amounts is not smaller than ((the element in the amounts*the first argument)/v0), and the address of this contract does not equal to the element in the amounts1 is greater than 0:\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the element in the amounts1 with the following argument list: caller, and ((the element in the amounts*the first argument)/v0), and gets the returned value as v1.\n\nFor the payable function add_liquidity, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: uint256[4], uint256.\n  When locked is 0:\n  - the state variable locked will be updated to 1.\n  When locked is 0, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0, and totalSupply1 is 0, and ((totalSupply2*4)/totalSupply2) equals to 4 or totalSupply2 is 0 is greater than 0, and the address of this contract does not equal to the external contract token is greater than 0:\n  - it delegates a call to the external contract token with the 0x18160ddd argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: .\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
