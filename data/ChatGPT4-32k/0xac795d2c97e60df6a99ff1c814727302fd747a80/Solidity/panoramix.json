				"content": "I'm sorry, but the provided decompiled code seems incomplete. There is no actual decompiled Solidity code provided. \n\nHowever, to give you an idea of how a Solidity smart contract looks, here is a simple example:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SimpleStorage {\n    uint storedData;\n\n    function set(uint x) public {\n        storedData = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint) {\n        return storedData;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract has two functions, `set` and `get`. The `set` function stores a `uint` value, and the `get` function retrieves this value. \n\nIf you have a specific decompiled code you want to translate to Solidity, please provide it.",
