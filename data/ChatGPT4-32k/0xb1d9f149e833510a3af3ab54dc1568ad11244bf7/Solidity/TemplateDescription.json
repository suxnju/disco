				"content": "Here is a basic template of a Solidity contract which contains the logic you described:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract SmartContract {\n    uint256 public s_0;\n    uint256 public s_1;\n    uint256 public s_2_31_32;\n    uint256 public s_3;\n    uint256 public totalSupply2;\n    uint256 public price;\n    uint256 public decimals;\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public deadline1;\n    uint256 public deadline;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        s_0 = 0x626c6f636b6f7074696f6e730000000000000000000000000000000000000018;\n        s_1 = 0x424f500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006;\n\n        if(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked((s_0/2)))) <= uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked((s_1/2))))) {\n            s_2_31_32 = 8;\n            s_3 = 0x1312d00*10**s_2_31_32;\n            totalSupply2 = 0;\n            price = 0;\n            decimals = 0;\n            owner = msg.sender;\n            deadline1 = block.timestamp;\n            deadline = 0x93a80+block.timestamp;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis is a very simple Solidity contract, but it should give you a good starting point. The logic you provided is quite complex and it's not entirely clear what you're trying to achieve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that this contract currently doesn't do anything with the Ether that is sent to it when it's deployed (the payable constructor). If you want the contract to do something with that Ether (like store it in a state variable), you would need to add that functionality.\n\nAlso, I noticed you mentioned that `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, but in Solidity this isn't the case. In Solidity, `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` is a very large positive integer, not `-1`.",
