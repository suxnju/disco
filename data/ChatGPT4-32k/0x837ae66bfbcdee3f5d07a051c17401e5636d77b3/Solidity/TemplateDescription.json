The contract includes functions for approving, increasing and decreasing allowances, and for transferring and burning tokens. Please note, that this is a simplified contract and does not include proper input validation and error handling. For a production contract, you would have to add more checks and tests to ensure the contract behaves as expected and is secure.",
