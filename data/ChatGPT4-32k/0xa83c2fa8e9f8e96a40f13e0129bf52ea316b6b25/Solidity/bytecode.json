The process of converting bytecode back to the original source code is called \"decompiling\". Decompiling can be complex and may not result in the original source code exactly, because information like variable names, comments, and formatting are lost during the compilation process.\n\nHowever, you can try decompiling the bytecode with tools like etherscan.io or similar, but keep in mind that the result will not be an exact match to the original Solidity code.",
