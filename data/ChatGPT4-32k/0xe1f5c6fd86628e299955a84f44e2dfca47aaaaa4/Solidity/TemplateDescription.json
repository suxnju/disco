The `fallback` function is used to delegate calls to the last completed migration for non-admin users. The `upgradeToAndCall` function is payable and allows the admin to update the last completed migration and delegate a call with a specific argument. If the user is not an admin, the function will delegate a call to the last completed migration with all the arguments. All the state variables are declared at the beginning of the contract. The `onlyAdmin` modifier is used to restrict some functions to the admin only.",
