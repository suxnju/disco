The goWiner function correctly checks and updates the winner based on the given logic, and the betYours function correctly accepts bets that are greater than or equal to the lowest offer, and updates the players array and sumofplayers variable accordingly. \n\nPlease note that this contract doesn't contain any overflow and underflow checking or SafeMath library, because it's just a basic implementation according to your provided logic and requirements. You should add these checks in production level code to prevent any vulnerabilities and attacks.\n\nAlso, this contract doesn't check if the address is empty before transferring ether. You should add checks to ensure that the address is not empty before transferring ether to prevent loss of funds.",
