It also includes methods for transferring ether and obtaining the current block number and timestamp, as well as blockhash, hash of the data and signature recovery. The transferEther function checks for the validity of the address and uses the `.call()` method for transferring ether. It also checks the success of the transfer. The getHash and getSHA256 functions use the inbuilt keccak256 and sha256 functions to return the hash of the provided data. The getSignature function uses the ecrecover function to recover the address associated with the public key from the elliptic curve signature. The getCurrentBlockNumber, getCurrentBlockTimestamp, and getBlockhash functions return the current block number, block timestamp, and the hash of the given block respectively.",
