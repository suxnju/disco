It also checks that the caller of the `destroy`, `initialize`, and `transferOwnership` methods is the owner, and that the new owner address is not the zero address. In the fallback and `buyTokens` methods, it adds the received ether to `raisedamount`, transfers tokens to the caller, and transfers the received ether to the owner.",
