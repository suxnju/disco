				"content": "Here's how the Solidity code might look like based on the decompiled code you provided. Please note that the decompiled code seems to be using low-level operations that are not typical in daily Solidity programming practices. It's also important to note that the decompiled code is incomplete and seems to be missing some context, which makes it difficult to provide a precise conversion. However, based on what you provided, here is a simplified version:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address private constant _target = 0xd80a503a2c2a5dddd8be53fb75bd48f0bb465ed4;\n\n    function __function_selector__() public payable {\n        bytes memory data = msg.data;\n        bool success;\n        bytes memory output;\n\n        (success, output) = _target.delegatecall(data);\n\n        require(success, \"External call failed\");\n\n        // The following line of code is unclear from the decompiled code, as it tries to return a data structure not supported by Solidity.\n        // return output;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the `return` statement has been commented out because it does not seem to be correctly represented in the decompiled code. The `RETURNDATASIZE` opcode suggests that it's trying to return an array or a similar data structure which is not directly supported by Solidity.",
