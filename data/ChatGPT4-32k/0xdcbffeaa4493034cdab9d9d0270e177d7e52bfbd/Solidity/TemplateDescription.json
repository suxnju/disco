The `fallback` function is marked `payable`, so it can receive Ether. When a function that doesn't exist in the contract is called, or when the contract receives plain Ether without data, the `fallback` function gets triggered. In this function, `delegatecall` is used to forward the call data to the target contract. If the delegate call fails for any reason, the transaction is reverted with an error message \"delegatecall failed\".",
