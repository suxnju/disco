A constructor that sets the contract's owner to the address that deploys it. This function is payable, allowing the contract to receive Ether upon deployment. \n\n2. A `withdraw` function that allows the contract owner to withdraw the contract's balance, and allows a specific address to take ownership of the contract and withdraw the balance.\n\n3. A `GetHoneyFromJar` function that allows any address to send Ether to the contract. If the amount sent is greater than the defined value, the function will attempt to send the contract's balance to the owner. If this transfer fails, the function will attempt to send the balance back to the caller. This function is also payable, allowing it to receive Ether.",
