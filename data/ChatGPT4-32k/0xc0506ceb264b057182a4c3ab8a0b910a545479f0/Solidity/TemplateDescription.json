This contract includes a payable constructor that initializes the state variables `deadline`, `deadline1`, `s_9`, and `s_10` with the specified values. There are also functions for transferring ether, calculating hashes, recovering addresses from signatures, and retrieving block information. Every function and process is implemented with security considerations in mind.",
