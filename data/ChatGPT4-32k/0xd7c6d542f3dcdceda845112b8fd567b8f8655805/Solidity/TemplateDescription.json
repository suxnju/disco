It also includes a `sendEther` function to send ether to a given recipient, a `getBlockInfo` to retrieve current block information, `computeHash` and `computeSHA256` to compute Keccak-256 and SHA-256 hashes respectively, and `recoverAddress` to recover the address from a given elliptic curve signature. Each function follows the best practices and security checks as required in your specifications.",
