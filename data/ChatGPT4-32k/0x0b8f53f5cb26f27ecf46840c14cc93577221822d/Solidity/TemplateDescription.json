You should wrap the arithmetic operations with SafeMath library in production.\n- In the constructor, the price is set to a hard-coded value. You should consider making it configurable.\n- In the NSN function, the total supply and the balance of the new owner2 are set to a hard-coded value. You should consider making them configurable.\n- The contract does not emit events. You should consider emitting events for state changes in production.\n- The contract has not been tested. Please make sure to test it thoroughly before using it in production.",
