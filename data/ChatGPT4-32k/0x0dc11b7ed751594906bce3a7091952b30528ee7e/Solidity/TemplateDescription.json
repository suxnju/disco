				"content": "Here is the contract following your description:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    uint256 private deadline;\n    address payable private owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function kill() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        require(address(this).balance == 0);\n        selfdestruct(owner);\n    }\n\n    function mineIsBigger() external payable {\n        require(msg.value > address(this).balance);\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        deadline = block.timestamp;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() external {\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\n        require(block.timestamp > deadline + 0x3f480);\n        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract includes a constructor that sets `owner` to the creator of the contract, a `kill` function that only the `owner` can call and only works if the contract balance is zero, a `mineIsBigger` function that can receive Ether and will change `owner` and `deadline` if the received value is bigger than the current contract balance, and a `withdraw` function that only the `owner` can call after a certain time (`deadline + 0x3f480`). Note that `0x3f480` is a hexadecimal number equivalent to `259200` in decimal, which is roughly three days in seconds.\n\nAll ether transfers are done using the `.call()` function as per the specification, and the `owner` address is made payable to allow such transfers. All requirements are checked before any state-changing operation, reducing the risk of reentrancy attacks.\n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any overflow or underflow checks. The Solidity compiler automatically throws an exception when an arithmetic operation leads to an overflow or underflow, so explicit checks are not needed. If you want to handle these cases in a specific way, you may need to use a library such as SafeMath or implement your own overflow/underflow checks.\n\nAlso, the contract does not check whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to him. This is because the Ethereum protocol does not allow zero addresses (0x0) to initiate transactions, so it's impossible for a zero address to become the `owner` of the contract. Nevertheless, if you have other requirements, you may need to add additional checks.",
