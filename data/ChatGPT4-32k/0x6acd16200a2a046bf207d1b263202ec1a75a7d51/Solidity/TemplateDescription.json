The `update` function is a payable function that takes one argument `dappID` and it updates the `totalHeartsByDappID` mapping if the ether sent is greater than `0x6c00a3912c000`. It also sends half of the received ether to the last address and updates the last address to the sender of the current transaction.\n\nPlease note that this contract does not check for underflows or overflows. For doing that, you would need to use a SafeMath library which cannot be imported as per your requirements.",
