Note that `msg.sender` is used to check if the caller is the beneficiary for certain functions. The `tokenreward` contract is assumed to have a `transfer` function that takes two arguments: an address and a uint256. This function is called via a low-level `.call()` function with `abi.encodeWithSignature()`. The fallback function is payable and implements the logic described. The `WithdrawETH` function sends ether to the `coldwallet` address using a low-level `.call()` function, and checks that the transfer was successful.",
