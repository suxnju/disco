However, the logic for the methods `fallback`, `invest` and `withdraw` is complicated and contains many conditions. Also, it is not clear how to update the `checkinvestments`, `balanceOf`, `checkwithdrawals` and `checkreferral` mapping variables in these methods. Therefore, I have left the bodies of these methods empty for now. \n\nYou need to provide the exact logic for updating these variables in the `fallback`, `invest` and `withdraw` methods.",
