As per your specifications, I've locked the pragma to a stable version (0.6.12) and made use of SafeMath for performing arithmetic operations to prevent underflow and overflow.

If it is, it updates the sender's balance and makes a transfer to the sender if certain conditions are met. If the value equals `0x104c533c000`, it makes a transfer to two different addresses and updates the balance of the contract. The SafeMath library is used to prevent overflow and underflow during arithmetic operations.",
