The `receive()` function is marked as `payable` to allow it to receive Ether, `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to owner-only functions, and address checks are included where necessary to prevent sending Ether to the zero address. The `abi.encodeWithSignature()` function is used to facilitate the external contract call.",
