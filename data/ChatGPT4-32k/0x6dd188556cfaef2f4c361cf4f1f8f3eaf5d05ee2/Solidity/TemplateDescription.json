It receives the Ether sent by the `msg.sender` and updates the `walletdeposits` and `wallettimer` mappings accordingly. It also makes subsequent calls to external contract functions `buy`, `sell`, and `reinvest` in the 0x0a97094c19295E320D5121d72139A150021a2702 contract. If no Ether is received, it updates the `withdrawedamounts` and `wallettimer` mappings and transfers a portion of the `walletdeposits` back to the `msg.sender`. This contract also checks the balance of the contract and performs additional actions based on the balance.",
