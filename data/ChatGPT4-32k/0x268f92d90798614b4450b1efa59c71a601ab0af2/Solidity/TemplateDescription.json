The `fallback` function is defined as `payable` and `external`, meaning it can receive ether and can be invoked by external contracts or ether transfers. It contains the logic you specified.\n\nPlease note: This code is provided as an example and has not been tested. Therefore, it may not work as expected in real-world scenarios. Also, there are potential security vulnerabilities with this code as it allows arbitrary external contracts to invoke the fallback function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Therefore, it is recommended to include appropriate access control mechanisms and other safety measures in production code.",
