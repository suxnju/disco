The returned value from the `isCutieCore` function call is not checked or stored in the `setup` function because it was not specified what to do with it. \n\nI also noticed that the `removeOwner` function sets the `isowner` value of the `_owner` argument to 0 regardless of its current value. This may not be the intended behavior based on the provided description. If the value should be set to 0 only if it is currently 1, you could add a check for this in the function.",
