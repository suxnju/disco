It has functions to enable and pause the contract, to withdraw all the contract balance to the owner's address, to change the `costwei` value and to transfer the contract ownership. A modifier `onlyOwner` is used to restrict access to these functions for only the owner of the contract. An event `OwnershipTransferred` is emitted when the ownership of the contract changes.",
