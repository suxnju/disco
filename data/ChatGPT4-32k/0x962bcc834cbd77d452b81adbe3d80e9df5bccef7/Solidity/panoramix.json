				"content": "Given the decompiled code as input, it appears to be a simple smart contract that doesn't allow any transactions by default and would revert any fallback calls. Here is the equivalent Solidity contract code:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n\n    fallback() external {\n        revert(\"Fallback function called!\");\n    }\n\n    receive() external payable {\n        revert(\"Receive function called!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above Solidity smart contract, the `fallback()` function is used to handle transactions that do not match any other function in the contract and it's not payable, meaning it can't receive Ether. The `receive()` function is a special function that is run when the contract directly receives Ether along with a regular transaction.\n\nBoth the `fallback()` and `receive()` functions are set to `revert`, which means the transaction will fail and all changes to the Ethereum state will be reverted if these functions are called.",
