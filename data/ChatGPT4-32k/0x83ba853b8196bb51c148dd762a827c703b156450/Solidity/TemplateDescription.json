The `collect` function is payable and uses .call to transfer Ether. The `withdraw` function uses .call to transfer Ether. The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to the contract's owner. The `transferOwnership` function checks that the new owner's address is not zero before transferring ownership.",
