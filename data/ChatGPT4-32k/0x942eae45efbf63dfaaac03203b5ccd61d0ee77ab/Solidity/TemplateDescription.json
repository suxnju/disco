The contract basically accepts Ether from investors, calculates the interest rate based on the contract balance and the previous balance, and sends Ether back to them based on their investment and the interest rate. In addition, the contract updates the block number each time the invest function is called. The amount of Ether sent back is limited to 1/5 of the investor's investment, 1/10 of the contract balance, and a constant value.",
