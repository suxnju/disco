The contract has a constructor that sets the `developer` address and initializes the `sale` address to 0. The `set_addresses` function updates the `sale` and `token` addresses. The `buy`, `buyWithFunction`, `buyWithAddress`, `withdrawToken`, `withdrawETH`, and `buyWithAddressAndFunction` functions are implemented as per the provided logic. The contract uses low-level `.call()` function for ether transfers and external function calls. It also includes necessary checks for zero addresses and failed transactions.",
