The contract is initialized by the constructor and the 'init' function, which are called only once.\n2. The 'burn' function checks the balance of the caller in the DGD token contract, and based on this balance it transfers the respective amount of ether back to the caller.\n3. The 'burn' function also checks if the contract has enough balance to cover the transfer.\n4. The contract uses low-level calls (`.call`) to interact with the DGD token contract in order to catch any possible errors.\n5. The contract includes a `receive` function to accept incoming Ether transfers.",
