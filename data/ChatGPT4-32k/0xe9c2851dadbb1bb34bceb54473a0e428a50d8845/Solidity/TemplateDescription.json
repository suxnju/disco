You'd need to add the remaining functions (like `claim`, `decreaseApproval`, `transferFrom`, `iwithdrawal`, `Withdrawal`, `fwithdrawal`) in a similar manner, following the logic specified in the task description. Also, please remember to add SafeMath library or equivalent to prevent overflow and underflow in the arithmetic operations.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to (the balance of the address of this contract-the first argument).\n          - the balance of caller will be updated to (the first argument+the balance of caller).\n\nFor the setprice function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: uint256, uint256.\n- For owner1:\n  - the state variable price will be updated to the second argument.\n  - the state variable last_completed_migration will be updated to the first argument.\n  - When the second argument is not 0:\n    - the state variable totalSupply1 will be updated to (the first argument/the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_2` is typed mapping,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `initialized` is typed uint8,private state variable `owner1` is typed address,private state variable `totalSupply1` is typed uint256,private state variable `last_completed_migration` is typed uint256,public state variable `price` is typed uint256,private state variable `s_9` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply3` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf6` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf9` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf4` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf1` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf3` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf5` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
