The `owner` is set to the address that deploys the contract.\n\nThe `transferOwnership` function allows the current `owner` to transfer ownership to another address. It requires that the `newOwner` is not the zero address and that the function caller is the current `owner`.\n\nThe `withdraw` function allows the `owner` to withdraw Ether from the contract. It requires that the `recipient` is not the zero address, that the `amount` is greater than 0, that the contract has enough balance to cover the `amount`, and that the function caller is the `owner`. It uses `call` instead of `transfer` or `send` to send the Ether, as per your specifications. If the `call` fails, it reverts the transaction.",
