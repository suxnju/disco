When Ether is received, it calculates a reward based on the current balance of the contract, the amount of Ether invested by the sender, and the number of blocks since the sender's last transaction. The reward is then transferred back to the sender, and the `invested` and `atblock` mappings are updated. Note that the contract checks for potential arithmetic overflows, ensures that the sender's address is not zero, and verifies that the contract's balance is sufficient before making any transfers.",
