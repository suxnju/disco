After a certain deadline, it either allows users to withdraw their ether if the softcap wasn't reached or transfers all the raised ether to the beneficiary if the softcap was reached. The contract also checks whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation and checks whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to them.",
