				"content": "Here is a Solidity contract that implements the logic described:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract BettingContract {\n    address payable public owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the contract owner can call this function\");\n        require(address(this).balance > 0, \"Contract has no funds\");\n        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n\n    function letsBetAgain(uint256 arg1, uint256 arg2) external payable {\n        require(msg.value >= 0x16345785d8a0000, \"Insufficient ether sent\");\n        require(arg1 < arg2, \"First argument must be smaller than the second\");\n        require(arg1 / arg2 > 0, \"Invalid arguments provided\");\n        require(address(this).balance > 0, \"Contract has no funds\");\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has an `owner` state variable that is set to the address that deployed the contract (i.e., the constructor caller). \n\nThe `withdraw` function can only be called by the `owner` and it transfers the entire balance of the contract to the `owner`. \n\nThe `letsBetAgain` function can be called by any address. It first checks that the ether sent with the transaction (`msg.value`) is greater than or equal to `0x16345785d8a0000`. It then checks that the first argument is smaller than the second argument and that their ratio is greater than zero. If these conditions are met, it transfers the entire balance of the contract to the caller (`msg.sender`). \n\nAll transfers are done using the `.call{value: ...}(\"\")` method as per the specifications. \n\nThe `require` statements are used to ensure that the conditions are met and to provide a reason if they are not (which will be included in the error message if the transaction fails). \n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any overflow or underflow checks as the provided logic did not involve any arithmetic operations where this would be relevant. Also, it does not use any of the listed built-in functions or properties as these were not relevant to the provided logic. \n\nThis contract should be used for educational purposes only. It is not suitable for handling real value as it does not include any security measures beyond the basic checks included in the `require` statements.",
