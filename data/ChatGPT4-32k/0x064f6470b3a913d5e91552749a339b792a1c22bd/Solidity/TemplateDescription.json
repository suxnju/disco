			"content": "Based on your requirements, here is a simple contract that should cover your needs:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address private token;\n\n    fallback () external payable {\n        (bool success,) = token.call(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(\n                \"logEthDeposit(address,address,uint256)\",\n                msg.sender,\n                address(this),\n                msg.value\n            )\n        );\n        require(success, \"External call failed\");\n    }\n\n    function sweep(address _address, uint256 _value) public {\n        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(\n                \"sweeperOf(address)\",\n                _address\n            )\n        );\n        require(success, \"External call failed\");\n        \n        address v0 = abi.decode(data, (address));\n        require(v0 != address(0), \"Invalid address\");\n\n        (success,) = v0.delegatecall(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(\n                \"sweep(address,uint256)\",\n                _address,\n                _value\n            )\n        );\n        require(success, \"Delegatecall failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract includes a fallback function that is called whenever Ether is sent to it, and it calls the `logEthDeposit` function on the contract at address `token`. The `sweep` function takes an address and a uint256 as arguments, calls the `sweeperOf` function on the contract at address `token`, and then performs a delegatecall to the returned address with the same arguments. \n\nPlease note that this contract is simplified and does not include things like access control or SafeMath operations. This is a base example, and you should add more features and security measures based on your project's requirements.",
