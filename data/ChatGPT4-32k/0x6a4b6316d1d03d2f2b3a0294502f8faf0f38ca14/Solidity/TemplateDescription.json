Please note that when implementing these conditions, you need to avoid putting too much logic in a single function, which makes it hard to understand and debug. \n\nAlso, please be aware that the contract code you provided doesn't seem to be complete and there may be some logical errors. It's recommended to review and revise your business logic before implementing it to Solidity code.",
