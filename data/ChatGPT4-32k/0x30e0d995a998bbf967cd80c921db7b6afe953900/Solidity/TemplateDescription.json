The `buyLambo` function checks if the caller is the `owner` and if the current timestamp is greater than a specific time. If both conditions are met, the `buyLambo` function transfers all ether from the contract to the `owner`. The `getContractBalance` function returns the current balance of the contract. The `getOwner` function returns the current `owner` of the contract.",
