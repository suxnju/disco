Remaining functions\n}\n```\n\nThis contract is a skeleton for your desired contract and only implements a few of the described functions. To fully implement your logic, additional code is needed. However, the logic you've given is very complex and doesn't seem to follow common Solidity patterns. \n\nIt's also important to note that `SHA3()` function is not available in Solidity. Instead, you should use `keccak256` for hash computations. Additionally, the suggested use of `SHA3()` in your description doesn't seem to fit into Solidity's type system. \n\nFurthermore, the contract doesn't compile due to the use of undeclared variables and functions, and the use of contract-wide variables in the constructor in a way that doesn't seem to make much sense. \n\nI'd recommend rethinking your contract's design to make it simpler and more in line with common Solidity patterns.",
