Also, the description seems to have some incorrect logic (e.g., checking if a number is greater than itself). Therefore, this is a simplified version of the contract, which only contains the structure of the contract with some example logic.\n\nThe contract contains a payable constructor, which means that it can be paid for upon creation. It also contains several functions including `setAdministrator`, `transfer`, `sell`, `buy`, and `exit`. These functions include the logic for managing administrators, transferring tokens, selling tokens, buying tokens, and exiting the contract.",
