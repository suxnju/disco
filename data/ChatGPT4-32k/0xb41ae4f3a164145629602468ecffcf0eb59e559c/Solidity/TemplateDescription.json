The constructor function is payable and sets the `owner` to the creator of the contract. There are `cancelWithdraw`, `transferOwnership` and `backendWithdraw` functions for updating balances, transferring ownership and withdrawing funds respectively. Note that the transfer of funds is implemented using `.call()` instead of `.send()` or `.transfer()`, as per the specification. The `backendWithdraw` function also checks that the destination address is not zero, the caller is the owner, and the contract has enough balance before making the transfer. The contract also includes a fallback function to receive Ether.",
