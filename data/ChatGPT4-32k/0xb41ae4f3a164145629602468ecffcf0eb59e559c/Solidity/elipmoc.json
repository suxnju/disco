The owner can manually withdraw on behalf of users and also transfer ownership of the contract. The contract keeps track of how many times a user has canceled their withdrawal.\n\nPlease note that the provided decompiled code was not complete, so some assumptions were made in the creation of this Solidity contract. It is also important to note that the actual contract may behave differently based on the original EVM bytecode.",
