It checks whether the deposit matches the required amount, and whether the second argument length is greater than 0. If the first argument length is greater than 0, it updates the guardiansbytes20 mapping with the converted first argument. It also updates the tokenUri of the sender if certain conditions are met.\n- `update`: Allows a user to update their tokenUri. It checks whether the tokenUri of the sender is not empty and whether the second argument length is greater than 0. If certain conditions are met, it updates the tokenUri of the sender.\n- `leave`: Allows a user to leave, refunding their deposit. It checks whether the tokenUri of the sender is not empty, whether the registrationmintime plus the converted tokenUri of the sender is not smaller than the converted tokenUri of the sender, whether the converted tokenUri of the sender is smaller than the guardiansbytes20 of the sender, and whether the guardiansbytes20 of the sender plus a large number is smaller than the guardiansbytes20 of the sender. If all checks pass, it transfers the registration deposit back to the sender and sets their tokenUri to an empty string.",

For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
