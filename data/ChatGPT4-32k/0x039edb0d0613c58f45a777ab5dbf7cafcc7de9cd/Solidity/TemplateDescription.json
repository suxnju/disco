				"content": "Here is the Solidity contract code based on the provided specifications:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public soldTokens;\n    address public token;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        soldTokens = 0;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"New owner's address cannot be 0\");\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can transfer ownership\");\n        owner = newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function sendEther(address payable receiver, uint256 amount) public {\n        require(receiver != address(0), \"Receiver's address cannot be 0\");\n        require(amount <= address(this).balance, \"Not enough balance in contract\");\n        (bool success, ) = receiver.call{value: amount}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n\n    function safeMathAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 c = a + b;\n        require(c >= a, \"SafeMath: addition overflow\");\n        return c;\n    }\n\n    function safeMathSub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n        require(b <= a, \"SafeMath: subtraction overflow\");\n        uint256 c = a - b;\n        return c;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, `MyContract` is the contract name. The `constructor` is payable and sets the `owner` to the sender of the transaction and initializes `soldTokens` to 0.\n\nThe `transferOwnership` function changes the owner of the contract to a new address. It first checks if the `newOwner` address is valid and if the sender of the transaction is the current owner.\n\nThe `sendEther` function sends a specified amount of ether to a receiver address. It checks if the receiver address is valid and if there is enough balance in the contract before making the transfer.\n\nThe `safeMathAdd` and `safeMathSub` functions are used for safe mathematical operations, preventing overflows and underflows. They are marked as `internal` meaning they can only be used within the contract or contracts that inherit from it.",
