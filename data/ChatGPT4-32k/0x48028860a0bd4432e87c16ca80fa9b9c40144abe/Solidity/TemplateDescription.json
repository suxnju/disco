The contract also includes two `payable` functions, `newAccount` and `deposit`, which allow users to send Ether to the contract. The `newAccount` function updates the mapping `s_1` with the value of Ether sent if it exceeds `0x9184e72a000` and the current value of `s_1` for the given key is less than 1. The `deposit` function updates the mapping `s_1` by adding the value of Ether sent if it exceeds `0x9184e72a000` and the current value of `s_1` for the given key is greater than 1. Both functions can only be called by the address that deployed the contract.",
