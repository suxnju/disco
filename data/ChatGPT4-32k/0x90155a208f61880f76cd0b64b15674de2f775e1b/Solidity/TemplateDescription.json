If the delegate call is not successful, it reverts the transaction with an error message \"Delegate call failed\".\n\nIf there's value attached in the call (`msg.value > 0`), it transfers the value to the target address. If the transfer fails, it reverts the transaction with an error message \"Transfer of ETH failed\".\n\nThe contract also checks if the target address is not empty before the delegate call. If it is empty, it reverts the transaction with an error message \"Target address cannot be 0\".",
