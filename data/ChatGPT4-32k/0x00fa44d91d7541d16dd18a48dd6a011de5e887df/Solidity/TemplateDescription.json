Please note that this contract assumes `getAmount` and `transferFrom` functions are implemented in the `token` and `token1` contracts respectively. Also, the owner can change the `token`, `token1`, `owner2` and `minimaltokens` variables but regular users cannot. \n\nThis contract is also using the payable fallback function, which allows the contract to receive ether. The ether can be withdrawn by the owner only. \n\nRemember: Always test contracts in a test environment before deploying to the main network.",
