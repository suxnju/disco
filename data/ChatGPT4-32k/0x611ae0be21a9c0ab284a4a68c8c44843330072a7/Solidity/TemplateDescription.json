If the function was called with an attached value greater than 0x38d7ea4c68000, the function will transfer all the balance of the contract to the rouletteowner.\n\nThe `StartRoulette` function can be called by any address, but only if the result variable is 0 (game not started). The function will set the result variable to the argument of the function and will set the rouletteowner variable to the address that called the function.\n\nThe `Play` function can be called by any address, if the result variable is equal to the argument of the function, the origin of the transaction is the address that called the function, the finished variable is false (game not finished) and the function was called with an attached value greater than 0x38d7ea4c68000. If all these conditions are met, the function will transfer all the balance of the contract to the address that called the function and will set the finished variable to true (game finished).",
