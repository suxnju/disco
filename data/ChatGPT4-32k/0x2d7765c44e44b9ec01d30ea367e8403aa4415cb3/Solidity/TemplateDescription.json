It has a payable fallback function which updates the jackpot and house_edge with each transaction. When certain conditions are met, it transfers a portion of the jackpot to the sender and updates the total wins count and the total wins amount. It also includes functions to start and stop the game as well as to transfer a portion of the house edge to the owner.",
