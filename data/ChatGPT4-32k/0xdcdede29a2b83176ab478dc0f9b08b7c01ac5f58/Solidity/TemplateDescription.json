Contract owner can set a dispute fee, set a custom dispute fee for a particular key, set the address of an external contract called RealityCheck, withdraw the entire balance of the contract to a specified address, set a question fee in the RealityCheck contract, transfer the ownership of the contract to another address, call a withdraw function in the RealityCheck contract, and submit an answer by an arbitrator to a question in the RealityCheck contract.\n\nAnyone can request arbitration for a question by sending Ether. The amount of Ether sent plus the existing bounty for the question must be greater or equal to the dispute fee, either the default fee or the custom fee for the question. If this condition is met, a notifyOfArbitrationRequest is made to the RealityCheck contract. If the condition is not met, an isFinalized call is made to the RealityCheck contract.",
