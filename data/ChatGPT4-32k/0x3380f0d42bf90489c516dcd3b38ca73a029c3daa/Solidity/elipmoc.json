I used `pragma solidity ^0.8.4;` but you should use the compiler version that matches your development environment.\n\n2. The contract `Ownership` has an `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict certain functions to be invoked only by the owner.\n\n3. The fallback function is defined to receive funds sent to the contract.\n\n4. The `withdrawFunds` function allows the contract owner to withdraw specified amount of funds from the contract. It checks whether the contract's balance is sufficient before initiating the transfer.\n\n5. The `renounceOwnership` function allows the contract owner to relinquish ownership.\n\n6. The `transferOwnership` function allows the contract owner to transfer ownership to a new owner. The new owner address must not be a zero address.\n\n7. The function selector code is not present in the Solidity code as it is automatically handled by the EVM, so it was not included in the recompiled Solidity code.",
