				"content": "Based on the decompiled code, here is the equivalent Solidity contract:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    \n    fallback() external payable {\n        revert();\n    }\n    \n    function destroy() public { \n        selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));\n    }\n\n    function __function_selector__(uint32 function_selector) public payable { \n        if (msg.data.length >= 4) {\n            if (0x83197ef0 == function_selector) {\n                destroy();\n            }\n        }\n        revert();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that:\n1. The `fallback` function is a function that is executed if the function signature does not match any of the available functions in a contract. It has been made `external` and `payable` to allow it to receive ethers that are sent directly to the contract address.\n\n2. The `selfdestruct` function is used to destroy the contract and send its funds to the address provided as an argument to this function. It's important to note that the `selfdestruct` function is irrevocable and should be used with caution. \n\n3. The `__function_selector__` function appears to be a custom function designed to select a function based on a provided function selector. If the provided selector matches a hardcoded value, the `destroy` function is called.\n\n4. The `msg.data.length >= 4` condition is used to check that the incoming data is at least 4 bytes long, which is the size of a function selector in Solidity.\n\n5. The `payable` keyword is used in `selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender))` to make the address convertible to the address payable type. \n\n6. The Solidity version `^0.8.0` is used because the `selfdestruct` function only accepts an argument of `address payable` type from this version onwards.",
