				"content": "The bytecode you provided appears to be the result of compiling a simple Solidity contract. However, it's not possible to provide an exact Solidity source code that corresponds to this bytecode because the process of compiling Solidity to bytecode is a one-way process. It means, we can't decompile the bytecode back into the original Solidity source code.\n\nThe bytecode can be disassembled into EVM opcodes which can give us an idea of what the contract does, but it won't be in the high-level Solidity language that it was originally written in.\n\nHere is an example of what the Solidity code might look like, based on the function selector that I can make out (`83197ef0` corresponds to a function signature, but without the original source code we cannot know for sure what the function name and parameters are):\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract Example {\n    function unknownFunction(bytes32 param1) public {\n        // The functionality cannot be determined from the bytecode\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is just a guess based on the bytecode. The actual functionality, state variables, events, etc. of the contract cannot be determined from the bytecode alone.",
