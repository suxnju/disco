				"content": "Below is the Solidity smart contract as per your specification:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract DestroyContract {\n    address payable public owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function destroy() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can destroy the contract\");\n        selfdestruct(owner);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\nFirstly, the pragma directive is used to specify that the contract is compatible with version 0.6.12 of the Solidity compiler.\n\nIn the contract, an address type state variable `owner` is declared. It's marked as `payable` because the contract balance will be sent to this address when the contract is destroyed.\n\nThe `constructor` function is a special function that is executed at the time of contract creation, and it's used here to set the contract's `owner` to the address that deployed the contract.\n\nThe `destroy` function is where the contract gets destroyed. Here, `selfdestruct` is used which destroys the contract and sends its balance to the specified address. In this case, the balance is sent to the `owner`.\n\nSecurity is enforced by ensuring that only the `owner` of the contract can destroy it. This is done by checking `msg.sender` (the address calling the function) against the `owner` address, and if they don't match, the transaction is reverted and the error message \"Only owner can destroy the contract\" is returned.",
