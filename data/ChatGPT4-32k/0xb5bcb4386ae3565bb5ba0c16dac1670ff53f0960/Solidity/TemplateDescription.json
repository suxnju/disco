It also has a `receive` function that accepts Ether payments. The address that is going to receive the delegated call is set as `targetAddress` which is a `payable` address. \n\nThe `fallback` function checks if the `targetAddress` is zero before performing the delegated call, and it reverts if the call fails. The `receive` function requires the sent value to be greater than zero, and reverts otherwise.",
