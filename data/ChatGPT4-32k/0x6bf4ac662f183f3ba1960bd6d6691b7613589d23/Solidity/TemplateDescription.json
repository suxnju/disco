				"content": "Sure, here is a contract sample based on your description and programming specifications:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract Dividends {\n    address public adminaddress_1;\n    address public adminaddress_2;\n    address public adminaddress_3;\n    address payable public token;\n\n    constructor(address _adminaddress_1, address _adminaddress_2, address _adminaddress_3, address payable _token) public {\n        adminaddress_1 = _adminaddress_1;\n        adminaddress_2 = _adminaddress_2;\n        adminaddress_3 = _adminaddress_3;\n        token = _token;\n    }\n\n    function transferDividends() public payable {\n        require(msg.sender == adminaddress_1 || msg.sender == adminaddress_2 || msg.sender == adminaddress_3, \"Only admin can call this function.\");\n        require(address(this).balance > 0, \"No dividends to transfer.\");\n\n        bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(\"sendDividends()\");\n        (bool success, ) = token.call.value(address(this).balance)(data);\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, the `transferDividends()` function can only be called by the addresses stored in `adminaddress_1`, `adminaddress_2`, or `adminaddress_3`. It checks if there's any ether balance in the contract and if so, it calls the `sendDividends()` function of the `token` contract, passing all the balance of the current contract. If the call fails, it reverts the transaction.\n\nThe constructor receives the admin addresses and the token contract address and sets the state variables accordingly.\n\nPlease note that the code does not check if the token contract's `sendDividends()` is a payable function, or if it's actually capable of receiving ether. It's assumed that you have control over that contract and you know it can receive ether.",
