The fallback function then transfers the half of the contract's balance to each of the two specified addresses. By using `call` function, we can send ether to those addresses. `call` returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful, and we check these to make sure the transfers were successful. Also, safemath operations aren't necessary here as we are just dividing the balance by 2 which won't lead to any overflow or underflow.",
