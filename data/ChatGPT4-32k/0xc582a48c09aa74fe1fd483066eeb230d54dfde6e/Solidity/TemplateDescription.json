The `purchase` function uses a low-level `call` to interact with an external contract, encoding the function signature and arguments using `abi.encodePacked` and `keccak256`.\n\nPlease note, you should thoroughly test this contract in a safe environment before using it on the live network. It's also highly recommended to have a contract audited by a third party before it's used in production.",
