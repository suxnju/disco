The `withdraw` function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw the full balance of the contract. It first checks if the caller is the owner of the contract, and then checks if the contract has any funds. If these conditions are met, it sends the full balance of the contract to the owner.\n\nThe `multiplicate` function takes an address as an argument, checks if the address is not zero, and if the value sent with the function call is greater or equal to the balance of the contract. If these conditions are met, it sends the sum of the value sent with the function call and the balance of the contract to the provided address.\n\nBoth functions are `payable`, which means they can receive ether. Both functions also use the `.call` function to transfer ether, as required by the specifications.",
