For instance, checks in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions have been optimized and the `approveAndCall` function has been simplified.\n\nThe code also assumes that the balances are in wei, and the buy price is also in wei per token. \n\nKeep in mind that this is a simple example and real-world contracts require more checks and tests to ensure security and correctness.",
