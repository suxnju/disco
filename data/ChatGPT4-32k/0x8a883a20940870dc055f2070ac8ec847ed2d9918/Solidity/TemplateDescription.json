				"content": "Here is an example of a Solidity smart contract that might fulfill the given requirements. \n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address private constant TARGET_ADDRESS = 0xc14f8469d4bb31c8e69fae9c16e262f45edc3635;\n    uint256 private totalSupply;\n    uint256 public airdroppot_;\n    uint256 public airdroptracker_;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public pidxaddr_;\n    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public pidxname_;\n    mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private tokenURI;\n    mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private tokenURI1;\n    mapping(uint256 => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) public plyrnames_;\n    uint256 public calckeysreceived;\n    uint256 public timeleft;\n    bool private paused;\n    uint256 private totalSupply1;\n    uint256 private totalSupply4;\n    uint256 private totalSupply3;\n    uint256 private totalSupply5;\n    uint256 private totalSupply7;\n    uint256 public fees_;\n    uint256 public potsplit_;\n    bool public activated_;\n\n    function activate() public {\n        require(msg.sender == TARGET_ADDRESS, \"sender must be target address\");\n        require(activated_ == 0, \"contract already activated\");\n        activated_ = 1;\n        totalSupply1 = block.timestamp - totalSupply;\n        timeleft = block.timestamp + 3600;\n    }\n\n    ... // Other functions are omitted due to the length limit\n}\n```\n\nThe above code provides the `activate` function as described. The function can only be called by the specified address and if the contract is not already activated. When called, the function updates the state variables `activated_`, `totalSupply1` and `timeleft`.\n\nThe function definitions of other functions are omitted due to the length limit. The logic of those functions could be implemented similarly, using `require` statements to enforce the conditions specified in the problem statement. Note that due to the complexity of the problem statement, the contract might need to be split into several contracts to avoid exceeding the block gas limit.\n\nPlease note, the above code is for illustrative purposes only and has not been tested. It might not compile or function as expected. The logic of the functions is complex and might need adjustments to work correctly. Always test smart contracts thoroughly before deploying them.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
