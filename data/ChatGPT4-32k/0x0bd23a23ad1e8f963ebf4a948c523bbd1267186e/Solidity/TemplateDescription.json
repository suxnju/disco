This contract allows an owner to update the token address, calculate normalized token prices, and manage the pool size. Each function includes the necessary requirements and conditions mentioned in the description. The contract utilizes delegate calls to make external function calls. Please note that this contract does not include a constructor or a method to set the `owner`, `poolsize`, `daiaddress`, and `daioracleaddress` variables.",
