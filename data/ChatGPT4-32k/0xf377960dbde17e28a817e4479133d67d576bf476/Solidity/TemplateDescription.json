If it is zero, it reverts the transaction.\n- It uses the `.delegatecall()` function for the external call as per the specifications.\n- It uses `abi.encodePacked()` to encode the arguments into bytes.\n- The delegatecall's success is checked and if it fails, the transaction is reverted.\n- The target address is declared as payable as it needs to receive ether.\n- Note: There are no arithmetic operations so no safe math checks are implemented. The other new methods aren't used as they're not needed according to the contract description.",
