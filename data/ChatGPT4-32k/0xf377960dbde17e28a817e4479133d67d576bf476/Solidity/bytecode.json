				"content": "As an AI, I'm not able to reverse engineer bytecode back into its original Solidity code. Decompiled bytecode doesn't necessarily provide an accurate representation of the original source code because the compilation process is not bijective, meaning information gets lost during the compilation which can't be restored during decompilation (like comments or variable names). \n\nHowever, I can provide an example of a simple Solidity contract:\n\n```\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\ncontract SimpleContract {\n    uint256 public storedData;\n\n    function set(uint256 x) public {\n        storedData = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return storedData;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt's a simple contract for storing and retrieving a number. Please provide more specific requirements if you need a different kind of contract.",
