The called function uses the selector corresponding to the function signature `0x70a08231` with `msg.sender` as a parameter. The returned data is then checked for length and a specific value. If these checks pass, all the Ether balance of the contract is sent to `msg.sender`. The contract also includes a fallback function to receive Ether.",
