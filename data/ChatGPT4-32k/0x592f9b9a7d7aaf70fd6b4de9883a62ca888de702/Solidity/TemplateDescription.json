				"content": "Here is a Solidity contract that satisfies the given requirements:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address payable private owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function changeOwner(address payable newOwner) public {\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"New owner's address cannot be 0\");\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only current owner can change ownership\");\n        owner = newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function withdrawAll() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can withdraw\");\n        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, the `changeOwner` function only allows the current owner to change the contract's owner. The `withdrawAll` function allows the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract. This function uses the `.call()` method to transfer funds, which is safer than `.transfer()` and `.send()`. \n\nThe contract also validates that the new owner's address is not zero, and that the transfer was successful. These checks help prevent common security issues. \n\nThe `constructor` function sets the contract's owner to the address that deploys the contract.\n\nPlease note that using these methods or properties such as `abi.encodePacked(...)`, `keccak256(...)`, `sha256(...)`, `ecrecover(...)`, `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `blockhash(...)`, and `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` was not necessary to fulfil the requirements of this contract.",
