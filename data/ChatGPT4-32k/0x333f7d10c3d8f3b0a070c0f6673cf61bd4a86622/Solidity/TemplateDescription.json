Please note that `totalSupply` here is an address which is expected to be a contract address that implements a `totalSupply()` function.\n\nFor security, the `setTotalSupply` and `setImplementation` functions make sure the addresses aren't zero addresses. Also, the `emergencyRecover` function allows the `implementation` address to recover all the funds from the contract in case of an emergency. \n\nPlease replace the actual logic of `totalSupply` and `implementation` according to your own requirement.",
