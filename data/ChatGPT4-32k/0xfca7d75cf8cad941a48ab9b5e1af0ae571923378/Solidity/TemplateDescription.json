You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

When the gladiatortopower of caller is smaller than 0x2386f26fc10000:\n        - When the element in the queue is not greater than the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller:\n          - it transfers ether valued the first argument to caller.\n        - When the element in the queue is greater than the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller:\n          - For users, except for the element in the queue with index the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller:\n            - it transfers ether valued the first argument to caller.\n          - For the element in the queue with index the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller:\n            - it transfers ether valued the first argument to caller.\n    - When the gladiatortopower of caller is smaller than 0x2386f26fc10000, and for the element in the queue with index the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller, and the element in the queue is greater than the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller:\n      - the gladiatortoqueueposition of the element in the queue with index (the element in the queue-1) will be updated to the gladiatortoqueueposition of caller.\n      - the gladiatortocooldown of caller will be updated to 0x9184e729fff.\n      - the value (the element in the queue-1) will be put to the element in the queue.\n      - the value 0 will be put to the element in the queue.\n  - For partner:\n    - the state variable m_ownerfees will be updated to 0.\n    - When m_ownerfees equals to 0:\n      - it transfers ether valued m_ownerfees to m_owner.\n      - When the call or transfer fails:\n        - it transfers ether valued 0 to partner.\n    - When m_ownerfees does not equal to 0:\n      - it transfers ether valued (m_ownerfees-((m_ownerfees*15)/100)) to m_owner.\n      - When the call or transfer fails:\n        - it transfers ether valued ((m_ownerfees*15)/100) to partner.\n- For m_owner:\n  - the state variable m_ownerfees will be updated to 0.\n  - When m_ownerfees equals to 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued m_ownerfees to m_owner.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued 0 to partner.\n  - When m_ownerfees does not equal to 0:\n    - it transfers ether valued (m_ownerfees-((m_ownerfees*15)/100)) to m_owner.\n    - When the call or transfer fails:\n      - it transfers ether valued ((m_ownerfees*15)/100) to partner.\n\nFor the ChangeAddressTrust function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, bool.\n- For users, except for the first argument:\n  - For m_owner:\n    - the trustedcontracts of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n  - When the trustedcontracts of caller is not 0, and for users, except for m_owner:\n    - the trustedcontracts of the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `m_owner` is typed address,public state variable `partner` is typed address,public state variable `gladiatortopower` is typed mapping,public state variable `gladiatortocooldown` is typed mapping,public state variable `gladiatortoqueueposition` is typed mapping,public state variable `trustedcontracts` is typed mapping,public state variable `m_ownerfees` is typed uint256,public state variable `kinggladiator` is typed address,public state variable `oraclizecontract` is typed address,public state variable `queue` is typed array,private state variable `paused` is typed bool.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
