To mitigate this issue, the state should be updated before any external calls are made.\n\nAlso, it is very important to handle the result of the `.call()` function. This function returns `false` if the call fails, and this should be checked and handled appropriately.\n\nMoreover, there's no check for possible overflows when adding `msg.value` to the balance of the caller. A safe math library or manual checks should be used to prevent this.\n\nLastly, there's no check for the case where `block.timestamp - balanceOf1[msg.sender]` could be less than `0x15180`, which would result in a divide by zero error.",
