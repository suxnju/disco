				"content": "I'm sorry, but the provided decompiled code is incomplete, and there's no specific functionality mentioned, so I can't give an accurate Solidity contract. However, I can provide a very basic example of a Solidity contract for a simple storage of value:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SimpleStorage {\n    uint public data;\n\n    function set(uint x) public {\n        data = x;\n    }\n\n    function get() public view returns (uint) {\n        return data;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a single `uint` state variable `data`. It has two functions, `set` and `get`. The `set` function takes a `uint` as an argument and assigns it to `data`. The `get` function returns the current value of `data`. Both functions are `public`, meaning they can be called from any address.\n\nPlease provide more detailed information about the functionality you want to implement, so I can provide a more precise contract code.",
