I've implemented the parts that are clear and make sense, but you may need to adjust the code to fit your exact requirements. For instance, the transferFrom function is typically used to allow a third party to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner, given that they have an allowance. In your description, it is not clear who should be able to call this function and under what circumstances. Similarly, the payable fallback function is typically used to allow the contract to receive Ether, but in your description, it seems to be tied to the total supply and price of some token, which is unusual. You may need to adjust the logic to fit your exact use case.",
