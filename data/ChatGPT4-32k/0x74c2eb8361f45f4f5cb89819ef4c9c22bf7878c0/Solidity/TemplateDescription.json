When the contract is created, the constructor is called. The fallback function allows users to send Ether to the contract which in turn updates the balance of the sender and the total amount raised. The checkGoalReached function can be called to check whether the funding goal has been met after the deadline, while the safeWithdrawal function allows for withdrawal of funds after the deadline.",
