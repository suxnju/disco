The `withdraw` function calculates the amount to be withdrawn and transfers ether to the caller's address. It also updates the amount withdrawn by the caller. The `changeWallet` function allows a caller to change their wallet address, transferring their balance and withdrawal amount to a new address. Please note that this is a basic contract and might need additional checks and balances depending upon your specific use case.",
