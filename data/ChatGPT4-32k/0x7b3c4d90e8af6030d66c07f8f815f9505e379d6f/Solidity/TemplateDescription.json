It uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict certain functions to the contract's owner. The `burn` function makes a call to the `trade` function of the `kybercontract` with the specified parameters, and if there is return data available, it makes a call to the `burn` function of the `desterc20` contract. The `destroy`, `setKyberNetworkContract`, `destroyAndSend`, and `transferOwnership` functions perform the specified actions.",
