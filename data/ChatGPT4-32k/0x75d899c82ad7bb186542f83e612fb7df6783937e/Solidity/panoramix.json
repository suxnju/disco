The actual implementation of the functions would need to be filled in based on the specific requirements of the contract.\n\nPlease note that the decompiled code is incomplete and seems to have been cut off at several points (indicated by the \"... # Decompilation aborted, sorry: (\"decompilation didn't finish\",)\"). This makes it difficult to provide a complete and accurate Solidity contract.",
