the state variable owner2 will be updated to caller.\n              - the state variable owner will be updated to caller.\n          - the state variable name will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the approve function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument equals to 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n- When the allowance from caller to the first argument equals to 0, and the second argument does not equal to 0:\n  - the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n\nFor the pullTokens function.\n- For owner2:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+the balance of the address of this contract). Afterthat, \n    - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- When buyprice is not 0, and the balance of the address of this contract is not smaller than (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/buyprice):\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller+(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/buyprice)).\n  - the balance of the address of this contract will be updated to (the balance of the address of this contract-(the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)/buyprice)).\n\nFor the changeOwner function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner2:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n- the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n- the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\nFor the setPriceInWei function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner2:\n  - When the first argument equals to 0:\n    - the state variable buyprice will be updated to (the first argument*0x2540be400).\n  - When ((the first argument*0x2540be400)/the first argument) equals to 0x2540be400, and the first argument does not equal to 0, and the first argument is not 0:\n    - the state variable buyprice will be updated to (the first argument*0x2540be400).\n\nFor the sendEtherToOwner function.\n- For owner2:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to owner.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and for owner2:\n  - the state variable owner2 will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the transfer function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n- the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument+the second argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,private state variable `owner2` is typed address,public state variable `initialsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `buyprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
