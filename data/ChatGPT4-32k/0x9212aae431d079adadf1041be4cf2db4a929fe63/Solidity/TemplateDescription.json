The `withdraw` function can only be called by the owner of the contract and it transfers all the ether in the contract to the owner.\n\nThe `notify` function is payable and it takes an address and a string as arguments. If the length of the string is less than `0x100000000`, it will create a new contract with the string as the contract code depending on the length of the string.",
