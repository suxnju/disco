				"content": "The given bytecode is a compiled version of Solidity smart contract. Unfortunately, it's not possible to provide the exact equivalent Solidity source code just by looking at the bytecode. Bytecode is the compiled version of a smart contract and it's not a human-readable format. Decompiling bytecode back into the original source code is a complex task and might not provide the exact original code due to optimizations made during compilation.\n\nHowever, the given bytecode appears to be a contract that involves ERC20 token standard functions as suggested by the \"a619486e\" hash which corresponds to the ERC20 `transfer(address,uint256)` function. For illustration purpose, here is a simple ERC20 contract in Solidity:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.7.6;\n\ncontract SimpleERC20Token {\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;\n\n    string public name = \"SimpleERC20Token\";\n    uint8 public decimals = 18;\n    string public symbol = \"SET\";\n    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000000000000000000000; // 1 million tokens\n\n    constructor () {\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;\n    }\n\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);\n        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;\n        balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis is a simple implementation of an ERC20 token. Please note that this is just an illustrative example and may not represent the exact functionality of the contract represented by the provided bytecode.",
