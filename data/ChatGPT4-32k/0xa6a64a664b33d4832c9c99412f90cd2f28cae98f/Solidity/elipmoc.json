				"content": "The exact functionality of the decompiled code can't be replicated in Solidity as it uses low-level operations like `delegatecall` and inline assembly. However, I can provide an approximation of the functionality in Solidity which utilizes the function selector and delegate call concepts.\n\nHere's a simplified version:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    // address of the contract to delegate calls to\n    address public implementation;\n\n    constructor(address _implementation) {\n        implementation = _implementation;\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        _delegate(implementation);\n    }\n\n    function _delegate(address _imp) internal {\n        assembly {\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\n            calldatacopy(ptr, 0, calldatasize())\n            let result := delegatecall(gas(), _imp, ptr, calldatasize(), 0, 0)\n            let size := returndatasize()\n            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)\n\n            switch result\n            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }\n            default { return(ptr, size) }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis Solidity contract acts as a proxy, forwarding all calls to another contract (the \"implementation\" address). The `delegatecall` function is used to preserve the context of the calling contract. If the delegate call fails, the contract will revert the transaction and propagate the revert reason.",
