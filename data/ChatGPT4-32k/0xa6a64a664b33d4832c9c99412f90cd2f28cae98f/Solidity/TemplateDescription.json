The contract also implements a payable fallback function that checks if the first argument of the incoming call data equals to `0xa619486e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. If not, it delegates the call to the address stored in the `fallback` variable with all the incoming arguments. \n\nThe function `bytesToBytes32` is a helper function that is used to convert the first 32 bytes of the incoming call data to a `bytes32` variable. \n\nThis contract follows all the given programming specifications. It uses a fixed version of the Solidity compiler (0.6.12), it uses `.delegatecall()` for external calls, it checks for possible arithmetic overflows or underflows, and it does not import any external resources.",
