It has a fallback function that updates the `atblock` and `invested` mapping of the caller. It also has a check for if the `invested` of the caller is not `0`, in which case it performs a series of calculations and transfers the resulting amount of ether to the caller, then updates the `atblock` and `invested` mapping of the caller. It uses `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` or `.send()` when transferring ether to the caller.",
