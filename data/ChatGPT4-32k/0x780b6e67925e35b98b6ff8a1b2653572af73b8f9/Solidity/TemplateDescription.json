You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the allowance1 of the first argument will be updated to the allowance1 of the first argument.\n  - the allowance1 from the first argument to 1 will be updated to 0.\n  - the allowance1 from the first argument to 2 will be updated to the allowance1 from the first argument to 2.\n  When the hasconfirmed of the address is greater than 0, and the element in the totalSupply is smaller than the element in the totalSupply, and 0 equals to the balance from the first argument to 1 and 2 EXP the hasconfirmed of the address, and the balance from the first argument to 2 is smaller than the element in the totalSupply:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to 0.\n  When the hasconfirmed of the address is greater than 0, and the balance of the first argument is 0, and 0 equals to the balance from the first argument to 1 and 2 EXP the hasconfirmed of the address, and 1 is not smaller than the balance of the first argument, and the balance from the first argument to 2 is smaller than the element in the totalSupply:\n  - the value 0 will be put to the element in the totalSupply.\n\nFor the function transferETH, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n  When the hasconfirmed of caller is greater than 0, and (m_spenttoday+the second argument) is not greater than m_dailylimit, and (m_spenttoday+the second argument) is not smaller than m_spenttoday:\n  - the state variable m_spenttoday will be updated to (the second argument+m_spenttoday).\n  When the hasconfirmed of caller is greater than 0:\n  - it transfers ether valued the second argument to the first argument.\n  When the hasconfirmed of caller is greater than 0, and (current time/0x15180) is greater than m_lastday:\n  - the state variable m_spenttoday will be updated to 0.\n  - the state variable m_lastday will be updated to (current time/0x15180).\n\nFor the function transferERC20, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n  When the hasconfirmed of caller is greater than 0, and (m_spenttoday+the second argument) is not greater than m_dailylimit, and (m_spenttoday+the second argument) is not smaller than m_spenttoday:\n  - the state variable m_spenttoday will be updated to (the second argument+m_spenttoday).\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract erc20 with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `m_required` is typed uint256,public state variable `m_numowners` is typed uint256,public state variable `hasconfirmed` is typed mapping,private state variable `balanceOf` is typed mapping,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed array,public state variable `m_dailylimit` is typed uint256,public state variable `m_spenttoday` is typed uint256,public state variable `m_lastday` is typed uint256,public state variable `version` is typed uint256,public state variable `erc20` is typed address,private state variable `allowance1` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
