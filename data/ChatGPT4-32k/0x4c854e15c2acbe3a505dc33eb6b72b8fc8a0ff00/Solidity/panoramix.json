Therefore, some assumptions were made in the writing of this contract and some functions were omitted due to their complexity. For instance, the `tokensReceived`, `cancelRecoveryAndRemoveRecoveryAddress`, `execute`, `deploy`, and `listRecoverers` functions were omitted due to their complex nature and the lack of context.",
