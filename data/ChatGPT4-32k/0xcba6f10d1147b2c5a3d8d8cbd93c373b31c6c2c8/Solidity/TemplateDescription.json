The contract uses the SafeMath library to prevent overflows and underflows. \n\nThe `constructor` function will be called when the contract is deployed. The `approve` function is used to approve the spender to spend a certain amount of tokens. The `withdrawFunds` function is used to withdraw funds from the contract. The `triggerRefund` function is used to trigger the refund process. The `transferFrom` function is used to transfer tokens from one account to another. The `endICO` function is used to end the ICO. The `fallback` function is called when ether is sent to the contract. The `unlock` function is used to unlock tokens. The `claimRefund` function is used to claim refunds. The `triggerMinCap` function is used to trigger the minimum cap. The `transfer` function is used to transfer tokens from the sender to the receiver. The `createCustomVUP` function is used to create custom VUP. The `changeVuePayETHDestinationAddress` function is used to change the vuepayethdestination address. The `transferOwnership` function is used to transfer ownership of the contract.",
