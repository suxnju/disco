After the deadline, the creator can withdraw all ether from the contract. Users can buy tokens by sending ether to the contract, and the tokens will be transferred to the provided address. The number of tokens received is dependent on the token price and the amount of ether sent.\n\nPlease note that the provided contract does not include a check for potential overflows or underflows during arithmetic operations. Normally, it is recommended to use a library like SafeMath to prevent such issues. If it is necessary, please let me know, and I can add it to the contract.",
