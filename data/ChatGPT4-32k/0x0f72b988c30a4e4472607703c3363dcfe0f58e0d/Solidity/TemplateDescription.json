You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable paused will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable starttimestamp will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable endtimestamp will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable exchangerate will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable tokenssold will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable mincap will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable endfirstperiodtimestamp will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable endsecondperiodtimestamp will be updated to 0.\n- the state variable endthirdperiodtimestamp will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the transferTokenOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transferOwnership of the external contract token with the first argument.\n\nFor the unpause function.\n- When paused is not 0, and for owner, and the external contract token is not 0, and whitelist is not 0:\n  - the state variable paused will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the pause function.\n- When paused is 0, and for owner:\n  - the state variable paused will be updated to 1.\n\nFor the assignTokens function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - it calls an external function transferFromIco of the external contract token with the following argument list: the first argument, and the second argument.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - the state variable tokenssold will be updated to (the second argument+tokenssold).\n\nFor the updateIcoEnding function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- For owner:\n  - the state variable endtimestamp will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the withdrawal function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner, and the first argument is not 0, and after endtimestamp:\n  - it transfers ether valued the balance of the address of this contract to the first argument.\n  - When the call or transfer fails:\n    - it calls an external function transferOwnership of the external contract token with caller as the argument.\n\nFor the setExchangeRate function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- Before starttimestamp, and for owner, and the first argument is greater than 0:\n  - the state variable exchangerate will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the bonus function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- it calls an external function walletCreatedTimestamp of the external contract whitelist with the first argument.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner, and the first argument is not 0:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the refundPayment function.\n- it calls an external function isWhitelisted of the external contract whitelist with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds, and the investments of caller is greater than 0, and tokenssold is smaller than mincap, and v0 is not 0, and after endtimestamp:\n  - it calls an external function balanceOf of the external contract token with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function burnFrom of the external contract token with the following argument list: caller, and v1.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it transfers ether valued the investments of caller to caller. Afterthat, \n        - the investments of caller will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- After starttimestamp, and before endtimestamp:\n  - it calls an external function isWhitelisted of the external contract whitelist with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  -

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
