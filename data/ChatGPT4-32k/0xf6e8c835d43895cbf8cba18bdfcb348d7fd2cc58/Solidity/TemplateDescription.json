It also allows for the modification of the price, payment address, and secondary owner, and clears the contract's balance by transferring all ether to the payment address. The `deRegister` function clears a register entry. Please note that the provided instructions were unclear about the handling of CALLDATACOPY and SHA3 and hence these details are omitted in this contract.",
