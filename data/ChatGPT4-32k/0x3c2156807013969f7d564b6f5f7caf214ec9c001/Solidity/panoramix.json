				"content": "Sure, I can write a corresponding Solidity code for the given decompiled code. Please note that the decompiled code seems to be incomplete or oversimplified. Here's a basic contract structure that might convey a similar functionality:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    \n    // Fallback function\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // Ensure calldata is less than 4 bytes\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size is more than 3 bytes\");\n        \n        // Ensure calldata is empty\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Calldata is not empty\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a fallback function that is payable, meaning it can receive Ether. It also requires the size of the calldata (input data) to be less than 4 bytes and to be empty. However, these conditions are contradictory. \n\nThe first condition states that the calldata has to be less than 4 bytes. The second condition states that there should be no calldata at all. Thus, these conditions will always result in an error. The contract might need to be adjusted according to the actual requirements.",
