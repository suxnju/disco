The logic itself is implemented as specified, with appropriate checks for the zero address and failed transfers, as per good security practice. \n\nNote that this contract does not include any means of withdrawing ether from the contract other than the transfers specified in the `deposit` function. If additional functionality is needed, further functions would need to be added.",
