The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to the functions that should only be callable by the contract owner. The `whenNotHalted` modifier is used to prevent function calls when the contract is halted. The `receive` function is the payable fallback function that is called when ether is sent to the contract without data. Note that the `transfer` function in `token` contract should have the standard ERC20 `transfer` function signature for this contract to work properly.",
