				"content": "Based on the provided decompiled code, the corresponding Solidity contract would look like this:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    mapping (address => uint256) public owner_1;\n\n    function __function_selector__() public payable {\n        if (msg.value > 0) {\n            uint256 v0 = (3 * owner_1[msg.sender] / 100 * (block.number - owner_1[msg.sender]) / 5900);\n            (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: v0, gas: 2300 * !(v0 > 0)}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n        }\n        owner_1[msg.sender] = block.number;\n        owner_1[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- The original decompiled code has two different mappings named `___function_selector__` and `owner_1`. However, the `___function_selector__` mapping does not make much sense in this context as it is a mapping to an array (which is not supported in Solidity) and the value of this mapping is not used in the code. Therefore, I have omitted it in the Solidity version.\n- The `v0` variable is calculated and used as the value for a `call` function. In the `call` function, the value and gas are set based on this variable. If the `v0` value is not greater than zero, then the gas will be set to `2300`.\n- The `owner_1` mapping is updated with the `block.number` and the `msg.value` is added to the `owner_1` value of the `msg.sender`.\n- The contract does not have any restriction on who can call the `__function_selector__` function, and any ethers sent to this function will be added to the `owner_1` value of the sender.\n- The contract does not have any mechanism to withdraw the ethers stored in it. Therefore, any ethers sent to it will be locked forever.\n- The `call` function is used to send ethers to the `msg.sender`. If the call fails, the contract will revert the transaction.",
