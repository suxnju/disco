				"content": "Your bytecode appears to be a compiled smart contract representation. It's not possible to perfectly decompile bytecode back into Solidity code as much of the original high-level structure (variable names, comments, formatting, etc.) gets lost in the compilation process. However, using a tool like Etherscan's bytecode to Solidity decompiler, we might get a rough equivalent Solidity code. \n\nThat said, the bytecode you provided is too short to represent a meaningful Solidity contract. It appears to be for an extremely simple contract with very limited functionality. To provide a comprehensive example, please provide complete bytecode. \n\nHere's an example of a simple Solidity contract that might compile down to a short bytecode:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\n\ncontract SimpleContract {\n    uint256 public value;\n\n    function setValue(uint256 _value) public {\n        value = _value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the bytecode of this contract might be significantly different from the bytecode you provided. This is just a simple Solidity contract example.",
