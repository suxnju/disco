It also includes checks for possible overflows or underflows before arithmetic operations and ensures that a non-zero user address is provided before transferring ether. Please note that for security reasons, it is always recommended to use SafeMath for performing arithmetic operations in smart contracts, but as per the requirements mentioned, I haven't used it in this contract.",
