				"content": "Sure, here are the contract codes based on your descriptions:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address[] public proxyowner;\n    address[] private s_50408858891048400296230599216167071704371788382710640085414625610309090410496;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        proxyowner.push(msg.sender);\n    }\n\n    function transferProxyOwnership(address newOwner) public {\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"New owner's address cannot be empty.\");\n        proxyowner.push(newOwner);\n    }\n\n    function upgradeToAndCall(address to, bytes memory data) public payable {\n        require(data.length <= 0x100000000, \"Data is too large.\");\n        if(data.length < 32 && s_50408858891048400296230599216167071704371788382710640085414625610309090410496[0] != to) {\n            (bool success, ) = to.call{value:msg.value}(\n                abi.encodePacked(bytes4(keccak256('functionName()')), this)\n            );\n            require(success, \"External call failed.\");\n        }\n        s_50408858891048400296230599216167071704371788382710640085414625610309090410496.push(to);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease replace 'functionName()' with the actual function signature you want to call externally.\n\nIn this code, the constructor pushes the address of the deployer to the proxyowner array. The `transferProxyOwnership` function pushes a new owner's address to the proxyowner array. The `upgradeToAndCall` function checks the size of the input data, makes an external call if the conditions meet, and pushes the 'to' address to the s_50408858891048400296230599216167071704371788382710640085414625610309090410496 array.\n\nPlease note that this code does not include overflow or underflow checks because Solidity 0.8.0 or later versions have built-in overflow and underflow protection. If you are using Solidity 0.6.12 as specified, you may need to use a library like SafeMath to handle arithmetic operations safely.",
