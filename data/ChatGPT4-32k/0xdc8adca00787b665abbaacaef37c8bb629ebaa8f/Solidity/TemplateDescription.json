It checks that the provided address is not the zero address.\n- `payout`: Transfers the contract's ether balance to the provided `_to` address, or the `ceoaddress` if `_to` is the zero address. It requires that `ceoaddress` has been set.\n- `buyVotes`: Allows a user to buy votes for a given `_voteId`. It checks that the `_voteId` is between 0 and 7 inclusive, and that the sent ether value is at least `0x38d7ea4c68000`. It then increments the vote count for `_voteId` by the sent ether divided by `0x38d7ea4c68000`, using a safe math operation to prevent overflow.",
