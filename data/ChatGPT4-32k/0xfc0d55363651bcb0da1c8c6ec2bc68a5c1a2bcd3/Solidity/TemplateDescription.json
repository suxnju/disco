Note that some functions require the caller to be the owner of the contract. The balance checks are done using the `balanceOf` mapping which keeps track of the balance of each address. From a security standpoint, the contract also checks for overflow and underflow where necessary. The `FoundationTransfer` function uses the `.transfer()` method instead of `.call()` or `.send()` to prevent reentrancy attacks.",
