				"content": "Here is a simple Solidity smart contract that meets your requirements. It uses a payable fallback function to delegate a call to the specified address with all arguments.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract DelegateCall {\n    address private targetAddress = 0x0532fd6E1109756bE1503dAbe7194B70dF0257A7;\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        (bool success, ) = targetAddress.delegatecall(msg.data);\n        require(success, \"Delegate call failed.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease note that the fallback function is `payable`, so it can receive ether by calling the contract without any function name. The `delegatecall` function is used to call the function in the target contract in the context of the calling contract, preserving the state of the calling contract. \n\nIn this contract, the target address for the delegate call is hardcoded for simplicity. In a real-world use case, the target address would likely be passed as a parameter or set in a separate function with appropriate access controls.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that `delegatecall` is a low-level function with potential security risks if not used properly. So, it should be used with caution in production code.",
