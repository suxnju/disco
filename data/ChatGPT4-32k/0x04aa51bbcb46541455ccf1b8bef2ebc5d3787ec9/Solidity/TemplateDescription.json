Also, external function calls are just placeholder comments in this sample. You'll need to replace them with actual external function calls.\n\nYou might need to add more libraries such as SafeMath for safe mathematical operations and Ownable for ownership-related functions. This code also assumes that the address calling the functions has the necessary permissions to do so. You might want to add more checks and validations as per your requirements.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to (the allowance from caller to the first argument+the second argument).\n\nFor the supplyAave function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument equals to the first argument:\n  - it statically calls an external function getLendingPool of the external contract aave, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds, and v0 equals to v0:\n    - it calls an external function deposit of v0.\n\nFor the transferFrom function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, address, uint256.\n- When the first argument does not equal to 0, and the second argument does not equal to 0, and the second argument equals to the second argument, and the third argument is not greater than the balance of the first argument, and the third argument equals to the third argument, and the first argument equals to the first argument:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the balance of the first argument-the third argument).\n  - When (the balance of the second argument+the third argument) is not smaller than the balance of the second argument:\n    - the balance of the second argument will be updated to (the balance of the second argument+the third argument).\n    - For users, except for 0, and the third argument is not greater than the allowance from the first argument to caller:\n      - the allowance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the allowance from the first argument to caller-the third argument).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `pool` is typed uint256,public state variable `token` is typed address,public state variable `compound` is typed address,public state variable `fulcrum` is typed address,public state variable `aave` is typed address,public state variable `aavetoken` is typed address,public state variable `dydx` is typed address,public state variable `dtoken` is typed uint256,public state variable `provider` is typed uint8,public state variable `apr` is typed address.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
