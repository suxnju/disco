The fallback function allows the contract to receive funds and updates the balance of the sender and the total amount raised. The checkGoalReached function checks whether the funding goal has been reached after the deadline and updates the state variables accordingly. The safeWithdrawal function allows users to withdraw their funds after the deadline if the funding goal has not been reached, or allows the beneficiary to withdraw the total amount raised if the funding goal has been achieved.",
