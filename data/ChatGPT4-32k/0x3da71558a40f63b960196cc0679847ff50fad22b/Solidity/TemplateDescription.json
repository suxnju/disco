If they are not, you should replace them with valid addresses. Also, the `withdraw` and `checkMyWithdraw` functions assume that the `balanceOf` and `transferFrom` functions exist in the contract at the given address. If they do not, these calls will fail. Also, the `clawback` function assumes that the contract holds some Ether. If it does not, the function will fail.",
