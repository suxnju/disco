It's also executed whenever a contract is called with data but without a function signature (i.e., a plain Ether transfer).\n\nThe `require` function is used to ensure that conditions that must be met stay valid. If the condition within `require` evaluates to `false`, an exception is triggered, which reverts all changes made to the state during the current call (and all its sub-calls) and also refunds the remaining gas to the caller.",
