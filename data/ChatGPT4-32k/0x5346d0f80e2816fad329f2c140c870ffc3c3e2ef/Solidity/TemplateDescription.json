These functions first check that the new address to be set is not the contract's own address. Then, if the new address is not the current `owner` and the `authority` is not zero, it makes an external call to the `canCall` function of the `authority` contract. If the call succeeds and returns a non-zero value, the corresponding state variable is updated.",
