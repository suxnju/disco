It uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows. The contract includes all required functions and implements the logic as described. It uses the call method for external calls, checks if an address is empty before transferring and ensures that the contract is separate by not importing external resources. It also uses the methods and properties specified in the new versions.",
