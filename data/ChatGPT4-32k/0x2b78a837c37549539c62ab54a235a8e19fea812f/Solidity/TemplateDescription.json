For example, the requirements for the loops in the \"removeAdmin\" and \"changeRootAdmin\" functions are not clear, and the 'settle' and 'debit' functions simply assign the same value to 'escrowbalance' which does nothing. You may want to review the logic and correct it according to your real needs.",
