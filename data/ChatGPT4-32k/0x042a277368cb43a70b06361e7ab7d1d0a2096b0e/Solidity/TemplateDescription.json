The `payable` modifier is used to allow Ether to be sent with the contract function calls, and `require` is used to enforce the necessary conditions for function execution. The `.call{value: _amount}(\"\")` method is used to send Ether to addresses, which is safer than `.transfer()` and `.send()`.",
