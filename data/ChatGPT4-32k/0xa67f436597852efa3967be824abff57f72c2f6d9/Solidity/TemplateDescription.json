If the total funding reaches a certain threshold, the owner can withdraw. After a certain timestamp, if the minimum funding was not reached, participants can withdraw their contributions. The owner also has the ability to clawback all funds in the contract after a certain timestamp. The fallback function handles incoming transactions.",
