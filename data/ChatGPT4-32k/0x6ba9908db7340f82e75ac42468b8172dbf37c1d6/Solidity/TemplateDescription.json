The `party` function will allow the caller to transfer their hodled ether to their own account, but only if their hodled balance is greater than 0 and the current timestamp is after `0x5b89d680`. The function will fail if there is an issue with the transfer, ensuring that the `hodlers` balance is not prematurely reduced.",
