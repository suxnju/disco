For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

When the call or transfer succeeds, and the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0:\n    - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\nFor the payable deposit function.\n- When (the balance from 0 to caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)) is not smaller than the balance from 0 to caller, and (the balance from 0 to caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)) is not smaller than the ether just received (i.e., msg.value):\n  - the balance from 0 to caller will be updated to (the balance from 0 to caller+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n\nFor the withdrawToken function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the second argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to caller, and the first argument does not equal to 0, and the balance from the first argument to caller is not smaller than the second argument:\n  - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\nFor the availableVolume function, it has 10 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n- it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, the third argument, the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the call or transfer succeeds, and the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0:\n  - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `admin` is typed address,public state variable `feeaccount` is typed address,public state variable `accountlevelsaddr` is typed address,public state variable `feemake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feetake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feerebate` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `orders` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
