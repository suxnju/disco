It also includes a `transferTo` function that transfers ether to a specified address, making sure to check that the address is not empty and that the contract has enough funds to make the transfer. The `call` function is used for the transfer instead of `transfer` or `send`.\n\nPlease note that this contract does not include any overflow/underflow checks or uses any of the built-in functions or properties you mentioned. You would need to add those in as needed depending on your specific use case.",
