You might need to add more safety checks or adjust it according to your requirements. Also, I couldn't find a clear definition of the addresses 20 V42@0xc9@0xb0 12, 20 V49@0xc9@0xb0 12, and 20 V56@0xc9@0xb0 12 in your description, so I omitted that part. The code can be extended to include these cases when their definitions are clarified.",
