It includes functions for withdrawing funds, renouncing ownership, cancelling a sale, checking if an image is on sale, selling an image, transferring ownership of the contract, buying an image, and getting active ads.\n\nIt's important to note that the external contract `digitalprintimagecontract` is called using the `.call()` method with `abi.encodePacked()`, which follows the provided programming specifications. Note also that the `buy()` function is payable, as required because it uses `msg.value`.",
