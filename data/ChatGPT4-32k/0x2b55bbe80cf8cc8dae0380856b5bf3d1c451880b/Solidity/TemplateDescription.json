The `ExtendLife` function is payable and can be called by anyone to extend life by sending enough ether and updating several state variables accordingly. The `ClaimBlessings` function can be called by the savior to receive all blessings after doomsday. The contract uses the `.call()` function for transferring ether and includes require statements for security.",
