If you need to include these checks, consider using a library such as `SafeMath`. Also, the `withdrawTokens` function assumes that the token contract adheres to the ERC20 standard. It's important to note that the contract provided does not include any error handling or safeguards against potential security vulnerabilities which could arise when interacting with arbitrary contracts. Always audit smart contracts thoroughly before deploying them on the mainnet.",
