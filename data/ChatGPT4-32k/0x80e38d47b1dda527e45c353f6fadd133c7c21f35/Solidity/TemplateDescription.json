The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict certain functions to only be callable by the contract owner. The `buyPresale` function checks that the contract is not paused, that the caller sent enough Ether, that the caller has not exceeded their account buy limit, and that there are packages remaining. It then increments the caller's `accounttoboughtnum` and decrements `remainpackage`. The `withdrawETH` function allows the owner to withdraw any Ether held by the contract. The `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership of the contract to a different address.",
