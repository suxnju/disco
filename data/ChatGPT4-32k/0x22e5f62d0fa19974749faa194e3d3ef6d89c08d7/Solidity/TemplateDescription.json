The fallback function handles the conditions given. `approveAndCall` calls the `receiveApproval` function on the `_spender` address. The `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions handle the balance and allowance updates. The `redeemEther` function transfers Ether to the owner. Note that this contract does not use SafeMath for arithmetic operations, which is generally recommended to prevent overflows and underflows.",
