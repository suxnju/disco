For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the second argument+the balance from the first argument to caller).\n\nFor the changeFeeTake function, it has one argument and its type is uint256.\n- When the first argument is not smaller than feerebate, and the first argument is not greater than feetake, and for admin:\n  - the state variable feetake will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the changeAccountLevelsAddr function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For admin:\n  - the state variable accountlevelsaddr will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the testTrade function, it has 12 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32, uint256, address.\n- When the 11-th argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to the 12-th argument:\n  - it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, (the third argument*0x1000000000000000000000000), the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\nFor the payable deposit function.\n- When (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller) is not smaller than the admin of caller, and (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller) is not smaller than the ether just received (i.e., msg.value):\n  - the admin of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the admin of caller).\n\nFor the withdrawToken function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- When the first argument is not 0, and the second argument is not greater than the balance from the first argument to caller:\n  - the balance from the first argument to caller will be updated to (the balance from the first argument to caller-the second argument).\n  - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and the second argument.\n\nFor the availableVolume function, it has 10 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address, uint8, bytes32, bytes32.\n- it calls a built-in function sha256 with the following argument list: the address of this contract, the first argument, the second argument, (the third argument*0x1000000000000000000000000), the fourth argument, the fifth argument, and the sixth argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n- When the orders from the 7-th argument to v0 is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n  - it calls a built-in function ecrecover with the following argument list: SHA3(0x19457468657265756d205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a3332,v0), the 8-th argument, the 9-th argument, and the 10-th argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: private state variable `addressOfBountyMembers` is typed array,public state variable `admin` is typed uint160,public state variable `feeaccount` is typed address,public state variable `accountlevelsaddr` is typed address,public state variable `feemake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feetake` is typed uint256,public state variable `feerebate` is typed uint256,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `orders` is typed mapping,public state variable `orderfills` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
