When a valid bid is placed (i.e., `msg.value` equals `0x11c37937e08000`), several checks are done to decide how to update the `endtime` and `addtime` variables, and who the `latestBidder` and `latestWinner` should be.\n\nPlease note that the contract's balance is being updated as well, with a portion of it being transferred to the `latestWinner` and `owner` under certain conditions.",
