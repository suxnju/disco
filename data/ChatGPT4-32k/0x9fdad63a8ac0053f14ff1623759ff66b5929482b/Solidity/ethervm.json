				"content": "The decompiled code provided is not complete and contains pseudocode, but from the provided snippet, a similar solidity contract can be written as follows:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract Contract {\n    function main() public payable {\n        assembly {\n            mstore(0x40, 0x80)\n            let dataLength := mload(msg.data)\n            if lt(dataLength, 0x04) {\n                if iszero(dataLength) { stop() }\n                revert(0, 0)\n            } else {\n                revert(0, 0)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis contract contains only one function `main()`. In assembly within the function, memory at position 0x40 is set to 0x80. The length of `msg.data` is compared with 0x04. If it's less and equals to zero, execution is stopped. In all other cases, execution is reverted with no return data. \n\nPlease note that `stop` opcode has been deprecated and replaced with `halt` in newer versions of EVM. Also, using inline assembly in solidity should be done with caution as it can lead to mistakes and is harder to read and audit.",
