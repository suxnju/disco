It is meant to illustrate the basic concepts you described. In a real-world contract, you would want to include additional checking and error handling. \n\nAlso, this contract does not use all of the specified state variables `_maxtxamount`, `_maxwalletsize`, `_taxswapthreshold`, `_maxtaxswap` because they were not mentioned in your contract logic description. \n\nThis contract may not be suitable for production as it's very basic and doesn't include any checks for authorization. It's always recommended to have a Solidity expert review your contracts before deploying them to the mainnet.",
