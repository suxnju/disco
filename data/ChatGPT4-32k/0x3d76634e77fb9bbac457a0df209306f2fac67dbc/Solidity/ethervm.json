In the Solidity version of the code, I have used the `revert()` function to handle such cases which can be customized based on the actual logic of your contract.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that using inline assembly like in the example above is not recommended unless it's absolutely necessary. Solidity has built-in high-level constructs for most of the cases where you would need to use assembly. Using assembly code makes your contract harder to read, more error-prone and could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.",
