				"content": "Your request is not completely clear, but I'll try to interpret it as best as I can. Here's a Solidity smart contract based on your description:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length < 4, \"Calldata size is too big\");\n        require(msg.data.length == 0, \"Calldata size is not zero\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has a `fallback` function that is executed when the contract receives Ether along with data that does not match any other function in the contract. The `fallback` function requires that the size of the `calldata` is less than 4 and also equal to 0. Please note that these requirements are contradictory, as `calldata` cannot be both less than 4 and equal to 0 at the same time. This contract will always fail and reject all incoming transactions. \n\nAlso, please note that starting from Solidity 0.6.0, `fallback` function must be marked as `external`. \n\nYou should consider revising your requirements or logic.",
