For instance, you should include checks that the contract has enough balance before transferring any amount. Also, it is assumed that the `ERC20` token contract includes a `transferFrom` function. Please adapt the code according to your specific token contract. \n\nThis code also does not include any event logs, which are generally needed for DApps to track state changes. \n\nFinally, this contract assumes that the `admin` is a `uint160` address. If this is not the case, please modify the code accordingly.",
