When a call is made to the contract, the fallback function is triggered and forwards the call to the implementation contract. The return value from the `delegatecall` is then returned back to the caller.\n\nThe `delegatecall` function is a low level function that allows a contract to make a call to another contract, but execute its code in the context of the caller. This means that when the `delegatecall` is used, the called contract can potentially change the state of the calling contract.\n\nThe `setImplementation` function allows to update the implementation address. Please ensure to add access control to this function to prevent unauthorized changes.",
