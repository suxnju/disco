It has a fallback function which delegates any calls to the `implementation` contract. It also has functions for upgrading the `implementation` contract, changing the `admin`, and upgrading the `implementation` contract while also making a call to it.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may not cover all edge cases or security checks. Always get your smart contracts audited by a professional or use well-reviewed and audited contract templates from reputable sources.",
