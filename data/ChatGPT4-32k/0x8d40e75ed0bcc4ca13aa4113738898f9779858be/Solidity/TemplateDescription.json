It uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the contract owner can call the sensitive functions. The `fallback` function includes the logic for transferring tokens and updating the `unsoldamount` and `currentprice` state variables. The `withdrawToFounders` function transfers half of the specified amount to `owner2`.",
