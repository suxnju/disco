Afterthat, \n    - the balance of owner will be updated to 0.\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the setUpgradeAgent function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- When totalupgraded is 0, and the first argument is not 0, and for owner:\n  - the external contract upgradeagent will be updated to the first argument.\n  - it calls an external function isUpgradeAgent of OR, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function oldAddress of the external contract upgradeagent.\n\nFor the manualMint function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For owner, and the second argument is greater than 0, and the first argument is not 0, and stopped is 0:\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n  - the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (the second argument+totalsupply).\n  - the state variable mintedtokens will be updated to (the second argument+mintedtokens).\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `mintedtokens` is typed uint256,public state variable `totalupgraded` is typed uint256,public state variable `owner` is typed address,public state variable `ethfundmain` is typed address,public state variable `stopped` is typed bool,public state variable `lockstatus` is typed bool,public state variable `upgradeagent` is typed address,private state variable `s_5_20_32` is typed bytes12,public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `locked` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
