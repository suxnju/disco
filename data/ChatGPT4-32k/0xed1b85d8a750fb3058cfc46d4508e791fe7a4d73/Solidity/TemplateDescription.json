			"content": "Here is a Solidity contract that fits your specifications:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract Challenge {\n    bytes32 private challengeNumber;\n\n    constructor() public payable {\n        require(msg.value > 0, \"Should send some ether\");\n        challengeNumber = bytes32(uint(0x230b408bee030c71cc83273533065e07ab3037b85b0248a22284dfd88552cf));\n    }\n\n    function withdraw(bytes memory input) public payable {\n        require(address(this).balance > msg.value, \"Not enough ether in the contract\");\n        \n        uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance - msg.value;\n        require(msg.value >= balanceBefore * 2, \"Insufficient ether sent\");\n\n        bytes32 v0 = sha256(input);\n        require(v0 == challengeNumber, \"Invalid input\");\n\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract begins with a constructor that sets the `challengeNumber` to the specified value. It then has a `withdraw` function that accepts a bytes input and is payable. It checks that the balance of the contract (minus the value just sent) is less than twice the value just sent. It then hashes the input using `sha256` and checks if it matches the `challengeNumber`. If it does, it calls `selfdestruct` with the sender of the transaction, sending all ether in the contract to them.\n\nPlease note that the `selfdestruct` function is used here. This function can potentially be a security risk if misused. It permanently destroys the contract and sends all ether in the contract to the specified address. It should be used with caution.\n\nAlso, this contract doesn't prevent re-entrancy attacks, so take care of this if you plan to use it in a real-world application.",
