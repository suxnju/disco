They can also withdraw ether from the contract, provided they have sufficient balance. If the ether transfer fails for any reason, the balance is returned to the caller. The `owner` variable is set to the caller of the contract in the constructor function. The contract also includes a `getBalance` function to allow the caller to check their current balance.",
