You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function balanceOf of the first argument with the address of this contract as the argument, and gets the returned value as v1.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it calls an external function transfer of the first argument with the following argument list: caller, and v1.\n\nFor the approveAndCall function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- the allowance from caller to the first argument will be updated to the second argument.\n- When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n  -

it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n        - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function receiveApproval of the first argument.\n\nFor the payable depositAndTransfer function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- the balance of caller will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the balance of caller).\n- the state variable totalsupply will be updated to (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+totalsupply).\n- When the first argument is not 0:\n  - the balance of caller will be updated to (the balance of caller-the second argument).\n  - the balance of the first argument will be updated to (the second argument+the balance of the first argument).\n  - When 0 is not smaller than the third argument:\n    - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n  - When 0 is smaller than the third argument:\n    - When 32 is not smaller than the third argument:\n      - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n    - When 32 is smaller than the third argument:\n      - When 64 is not smaller than the third argument:\n        - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n      - When 64 is smaller than the third argument:\n        - When 96 is not smaller than the third argument:\n          - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n        - When 96 is smaller than the third argument:\n          - When 128 is not smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n          - When 160 is not smaller than the third argument, and 128 is smaller than the third argument:\n            - it calls an external function tokenFallback of the first argument.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `balanceof` is typed mapping,public state variable `totalsupply` is typed uint256,public state variable `allowance` is typed mapping,public state variable `accesspolicy` is typed address,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `symbol` is typed string,public state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `version` is typed string.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
