				"content": "Sure, here is a Solidity contract code snippet that follows your requirements:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ninterface IERC20 {\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);\n}\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address public hub;\n    uint256 public challengeperiod;\n    address public approvedtoken;\n    uint256 public hubreservewei;\n    uint256 public totalchanneltoken;\n    mapping(address => uint256) private s_5;\n\n    function getHubReserveTokens() public view returns (uint256) {\n        IERC20 token = IERC20(approvedtoken);\n        return token.balanceOf(address(this));\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, I have declared an interface `IERC20` that declares the `balanceOf` function of the `approvedtoken` contract. The `getHubReserveTokens` function then calls this `balanceOf` function with the address of the current contract (`this`) as the argument.\n\nPlease note, this code assumes that the `approvedtoken` contract follows the ERC20 standard. If it does not, you will need to adjust the `IERC20` interface to match the actual interface of the `approvedtoken` contract.",
