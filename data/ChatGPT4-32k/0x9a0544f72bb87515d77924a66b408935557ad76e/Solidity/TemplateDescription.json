There are also `setImplementation` and `setPayable` functions that can be used to update the `implementation` address and `ispayable` boolean, respectively. These functions can only be called by the current `implementation` address. If `ispayable` is true, the contract can receive ether, otherwise, it will reject all incoming ether transactions.",
