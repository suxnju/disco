The fallback function accepts ether and updates the `investfund` state variable. The `ReturnEthToEthero` function checks if the sender is `ethero` and if the balance of the contract is greater than `totalSupply`, then transfers ether to `ethero` and updates the `investfund` variable. Safe math is used to prevent overflow.",
