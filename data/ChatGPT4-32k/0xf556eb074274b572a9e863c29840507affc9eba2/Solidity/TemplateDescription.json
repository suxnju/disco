For example, the SHA3 logic you mentioned is not implemented because Ethereum has moved to a new hash function called KECCAK-256, and the old SHA3 function is not supported in Solidity. Also, the use of SHA3 or KECCAK-256 with the division and addition of string lengths (symbol and name) makes no sense in Solidity because strings are not numbers and cannot be divided or added. Similarly, the comparison of the hash with itself and hash+1 is also unnecessary because the results are predictable. Lastly, the use of EXP is not implemented because Solidity does not support the exponential operator. Instead, a library called SafeMath should be used for such operations to avoid overflow and underflow errors.",
