This would need to be added, for instance in a constructor function. Also, the code is using the `delegatecall` function for calling into the `totalSupply` contract, which means that function calls will be executed in the context of the calling contract (i.e., `YourContract`), not the `totalSupply` contract. This means that changes to the state variables of the `totalSupply` contract won't affect the `totalSupply` contract's state, but the `YourContract` contract's state.",
