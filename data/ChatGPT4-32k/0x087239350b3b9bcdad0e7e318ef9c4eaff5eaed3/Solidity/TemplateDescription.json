The descriptions for the functions `addLiquidity`, `removeLiquidity` and `swapTokens` are very complex and need more clarity. Also, the conditions within the functions are very dense and could be simplified for better readability and maintainability. Additionally, error messages should be added to all `require` statements to help debug any issues that occur. More importantly, the descriptions involve mathematical operations and condition checks that can't be directly translated into solidity without knowing the exact logic and purpose behind them. \n\nPlease provide more context or simplify the descriptions and I will be able to provide a more accurate solution.",
