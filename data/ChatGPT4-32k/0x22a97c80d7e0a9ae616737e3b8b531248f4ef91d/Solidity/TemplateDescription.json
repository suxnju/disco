You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

it calls an external function mint of the external contract stage with the following argument list: caller, and ((10 EXP v0*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))/tokenprice), and gets the returned value as v1.\n  When the external contract stage is greater than 0, and timemode is not greater than 1, and mincontribution is not greater than the ether just received (i.e., msg.value), and (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)+the contributions of caller) is not smaller than the contributions of caller, and bonusmode is not greater than 4, and bonusmode equals to 3, and 0 is not smaller than the element in the bonuslevels, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is 0, and (0xde0b6b3a7640000*the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)) is not smaller than 0:\n  -

the state variable earlysuccesstimestamp will be updated to current time.\n  - the state variable earlysuccessblock will be updated to the current block's number.\n  - it calls an external function finishMinting of the external contract stage.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `owner` is typed address,private state variable `paused` is typed bool,public state variable `pendingowner` is typed address,public state variable `id` is typed string,public state variable `name` is typed string,public state variable `website` is typed string,public state variable `whitepaperhash` is typed uint256,public state variable `fundingthreshold` is typed uint256,public state variable `fundinggoal` is typed uint256,public state variable `tokenprice` is typed uint256,public state variable `timemode` is typed uint8,public state variable `starttime` is typed uint256,public state variable `finishtime` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonusmode` is typed uint8,public state variable `bonuslevels` is typed array,public state variable `bonusrates` is typed array,public state variable `beneficiary` is typed address,public state variable `amountraised` is typed uint256,public state variable `mincontribution` is typed uint256,public state variable `earlysuccesstimestamp` is typed uint256,public state variable `earlysuccessblock` is typed uint256,public state variable `contributions` is typed mapping,public state variable `stage` is typed address,private state variable `s_21_20_32` is typed bytes12.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
