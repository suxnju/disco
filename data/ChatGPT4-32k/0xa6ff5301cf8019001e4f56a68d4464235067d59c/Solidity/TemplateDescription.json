			"content": "Here is a Solidity contract that matches your description:\n\n```Solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract DelegatedCall {\n    address payable public target = 0x7a061bD541Aa542656C8d0F7cA6dCE68A72ACC1E;\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.data.length > 0, \"No arguments provided\");\n        require(msg.sender != address(0), \"Sender address cannot be 0\");\n\n        (bool success,) = target.delegatecall(msg.data);\n        require(success, \"External call failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this contract, there is only one fallback function that delegates a call to the target address with all the arguments. If the function call fails, it will revert all the changes.\n\nPlease note that:\n- The contract uses the delegatecall function which is a low-level function to call another contract. It runs the code of the called contract in the context of the calling contract with the msg.sender and msg.value of the original call.\n- The contract doesn't perform any arithmetic operations, so there is no need to use SafeMath for preventing overflow and underflow.\n- The contract doesn't transfer Ether to user addresses, so there is no need to check whether the user's address is empty.\n- The contract doesn't use any of the mentioned built-in functions and properties as they are not relevant to the contract logic. The contract also doesn't involve any cryptographic procedures that require usage of hashing and signature verification functions.\n- The contract doesn't import any external resources.\n- The contract doesn't use the constant `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`.\n- The fallback function is made payable so it can receive Ether. However, the received Ether is not used in this contract.",
