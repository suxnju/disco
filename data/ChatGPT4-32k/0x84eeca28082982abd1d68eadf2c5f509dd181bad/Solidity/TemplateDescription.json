Users can refer other users and earn a bonus when the referred user hatches eggs. The contract uses SafeMath to prevent overflows and underflows. The `seedMarket` function initializes the game by setting the initial egg supply. The `hatchEggs` function hatches shrimp from eggs and gives a bonus to the referrer. The `sellEggs` function sells eggs for ether. The `buyEggs` function buys eggs with ether. The `calculateTrade` function calculates the amount of ether or eggs a user gets when buying or selling. The `devFee` function calculates the fee for the developer. The `getMyShrimp` and `getMyEggs` functions return the number of shrimp and eggs a user has.",
