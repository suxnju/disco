The `send` function allows the `owner` to send a specified `_amount` of ether to a specified `_to` address. The function is `payable` and uses `.call{value: _amount}(\"\")` to send ether, as required. It also contains necessary checks - for `owner` authorization, for non-zero recipient address, and for sufficient contract balance.",
