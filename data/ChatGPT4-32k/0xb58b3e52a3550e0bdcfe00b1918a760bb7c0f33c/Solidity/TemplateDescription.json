Afterthat, \n    - the tokensico of caller will be updated to 0.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it transfers ether valued the icoinvestments of caller to caller.\n\nFor the giveReserveFund function, it has 2 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256.\n- For manager, and the second argument is greater than 0:\n  - it calls an external function mintReserveTokens of the external contract cret with the following argument list: the first argument, and (0xde0b6b3a7640000*the second argument).\n\nFor the finishIco function.\n- When decimals equals to 3, and for manager:\n  - it calls an external function mintTokens of the external contract cret with the following argument list: teamfund, and (75*(bonus/1000)).\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function mintTokens of the external contract cret with the following argument list: teamfund2, and (75*(bonus/1000)).\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - the state variable totalSupply will be updated to 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00 and 0x40000 or addressOfBountyMembers.\n      - When 0x18d0bf423c03d8de000000 is greater than bonus:\n        - the state variable caniwithdraw will be updated to 1.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `teamfund` is typed address,public state variable `teamfund2` is typed address,public state variable `companion1` is typed address,public state variable `companion2` is typed address,public state variable `manager` is typed address,private state variable `owner` is typed address,private state variable `owner1` is typed address,public state variable `cret` is typed address,public state variable `rate_eth` is typed uint256,public state variable `tokens_per_dollar` is typed uint256,public state variable `token_price` is typed uint256,public state variable `bonus` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `addressOfBountyMembers` is typed bytes31,private state variable `decimals` is typed uint8,public state variable `caniwithdraw` is typed bool,public state variable `canibuy` is typed uint8,public state variable `icoinvestments` is typed mapping,public state variable `returnstatus` is typed mapping,public state variable `tokensico` is typed mapping,public state variable `tokensicoinothercrypto` is typed mapping,public state variable `purebalance` is typed mapping,public state variable `kyc` is typed mapping.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
