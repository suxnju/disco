			"content": "Here's a Solidity contract that implements your specifications:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    address payable private owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can withdraw\");\n        require(owner != address(0), \"Owner address cannot be 0\");\n        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: address(this).balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n    }\n\n    function getContractBalance() public view returns (uint) {\n        return address(this).balance;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's how the contract works:\n\n- The constructor function sets the `owner` to the account that deploys the contract.\n- The `withdraw` function checks if the caller of the function is the owner and if the owner's address is not empty. If both conditions are met, it sends all the ether from the contract to the owner. \n- The `getContractBalance` function returns the current balance of the contract, which is useful for debugging.\n\nRemember to test this contract thoroughly before using it in production. Also, be aware that using .call{value: ...}(\"\") can potentially allow the receiving contract to execute arbitrary code, so make sure you trust the receiving address.",
