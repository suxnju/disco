				"content": "Here is a Solidity contract code that adheres to the logic you described.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.6.12;\n\ncontract YourContract {\n    \n    address payable public owner;\n    uint256 public amountraised;\n    uint256 public amountraisedphase;\n    uint256 public price;\n    address public tokenreward;\n    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceof;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n    \n    modifier onlyOwner {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can execute this function.\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function destroy() public onlyOwner {\n        selfdestruct(owner);\n    }\n\n    function destroyAndSend(address payable recipient) public onlyOwner {\n        selfdestruct(recipient);\n    }\n\n    function safeWithdrawal() public onlyOwner {\n        owner.transfer(amountraisedphase);\n        amountraisedphase = 0;\n    }\n    \n    receive() external payable {\n        balanceof[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n        amountraised += msg.value;\n        amountraisedphase += msg.value;\n\n        if (price != 0){\n            if (msg.value == 0) {\n                (bool success,) = tokenreward.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"transfer(address,uint256)\", msg.sender, (10000*msg.value)/price));\n                require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n            } else if (((10000*msg.value)/msg.value) == 10000 && msg.value != 0){\n                (bool success,) = tokenreward.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"transfer(address,uint256)\", msg.sender, (10000*msg.value)/price));\n                require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the `receive()` function is payable and will be executed when a transaction with no data (and non-zero ether) is sent to the contract. \n\nAlso note that the `destroy` and `destroyAndSend` functions use `selfdestruct`, which causes the contract to be removed from the Ethereum state and sends all remaining Ether stored in the contract to the specified address. \n\nThe `safeWithdrawal` function uses the `transfer` method to send Ether from the contract to the `owner`.\n\nThe `tokenreward.call` is written in a low-level way using the function signature and arguments to make an external function call to `transfer`. This is done in the `receive` function which also updates the `amountraised` and `balanceof` mappings as per your description. \n\nThis contract has not been tested and it's strongly recommended to test it thoroughly before using it in production.",
