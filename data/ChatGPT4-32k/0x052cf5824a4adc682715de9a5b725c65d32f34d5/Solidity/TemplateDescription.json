				"content": "Based on the description and requirements provided, here's a simple Solidity contract implementing the described logic:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    address private s_2_12_32;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        s_2_12_32 = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function withdrawBalance() public {\n        require(s_2_12_32 == msg.sender, \"Only the contract owner can withdraw\");\n        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");\n    }\n\n    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {\n        require(s_2_12_32 == msg.sender, \"Only the contract owner can change owner\");\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"New owner address cannot be 0\");\n        s_2_12_32 = newOwner;\n    }\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        // accept ether sent to this contract\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract allows the owner (`s_2_12_32`) to withdraw all funds from the contract and change the owner to another address. The `fallback` function is needed to accept ether sent to this contract. It's notable that this contract has no way to add funds to it in normal operation. If you want to add a `deposit` function or similar, it would be quite simple to do so.\n\nFor the `withdrawBalance` and `changeOwner` functions, I've added `require` statements to ensure only the current owner can call these functions. For `changeOwner`, I've also added a `require` to prevent the owner from being set to the zero address.",
