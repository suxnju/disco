This contract includes 3 public functions `init`, `changeOwnership` and `acceptOwnership` and 2 public payable functions `handleFund` and `getMetBalance`. It also includes 2 modifiers `onlyOwner` and `onlyNewOwner` to restrict the access of some functions. Note that the functions are interacting with the external contracts `reservetoken` and `auctions`. The contract assumes that these external contracts have the functions `proceeds` and `balanceOf` respectively.",
