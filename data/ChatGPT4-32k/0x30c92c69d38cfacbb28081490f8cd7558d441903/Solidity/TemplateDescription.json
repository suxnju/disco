Also, I didn't write the payable functions because it would be better to separate the payable functions into different contracts due to security and readability. The contract code above is a general code that does not include some of the edge cases that might cause vulnerabilities. Make sure to test the contract thoroughly before deploying it to the mainnet. Please let me know if you need more function implementations.",
