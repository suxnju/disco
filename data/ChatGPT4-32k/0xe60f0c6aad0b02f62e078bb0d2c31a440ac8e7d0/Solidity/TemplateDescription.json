				"content": "Here is a simple contract implementing the logic you described. This contract is written in Solidity version 0.6.12.\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity 0.6.12;\n\ncontract Investment {\n    mapping(address => uint) public invested;  // The amount each address has invested\n    mapping(address => uint) public atblock;  // The block at which each address last deposited\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        require(msg.sender != address(0), \"Address is empty\");\n\n        if(invested[msg.sender] != 0) {\n            uint amount = ((block.number - atblock[msg.sender]) * (invested[msg.sender] / 100)) / 6000 / 24;\n            require(amount <= address(this).balance, \"Not enough balance in the contract\");\n            (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\");\n            require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n        }\n\n        atblock[msg.sender] = block.number;\n        invested[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis contract has two mappings `invested` and `atblock` to track the amount each address has invested and the last block at which they made a deposit respectively.\n\nThe contract has a payable fallback function that accepts ether transfers. It first checks if the sender's address is not empty and if the sender already has some investment. If they do, it calculates the amount to be transferred based on the formula you provided and checks if the contract has enough balance to make the transfer. It then makes the transfer using the low level `.call` function.\n\nFinally, it updates the `atblock` and `invested` mappings with the current block number and the new investment amount respectively.",
