This includes the logic for the contract's constructor, the transferFrom, transfer, and approve functions, as well as the fallback function. \n\nPlease note that the logic related to SHA3 and the name variable was omitted as it was unclear how these were intended to be used in the context of the contract. If these are necessary for your use case, please provide more context so we can incorporate them correctly.",
