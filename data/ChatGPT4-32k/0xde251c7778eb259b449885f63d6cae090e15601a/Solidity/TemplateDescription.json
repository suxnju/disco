Note that the constructor is defined to take in the address of an external token contract, which allows the contract to interact with the external functions defined in the `ITokenContract` interface. The `hatchEggs`, `sellEggs`, and `tokenFallback` functions require additional logic to be fully implemented. Since the logic is quite complex, it is recommended to add it separately, ensuring all the conditions and state changes are correctly implemented.",

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: caller, and 0.\n    - When (current time-the lasthatch of caller) is 0:\n      - the state variable marketeggs will be updated to (the claimedeggs of caller+marketeggs).\n      - When totalSupply is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n        - When 0 is not 0, and totalSupply1 is 0:\n          - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: ceoaddress, and ((4*0)/100).\n          - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n            - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: caller, and (0-((4*0)/100)).\n        - When totalSupply1 is not 0, and 0 is 0:\n          - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: ceoaddress, and 0.\n          - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n            - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: caller, and 0.\n    - When v0 is greater than 1, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - it calls an external function reinvest of the external contract tokencontract.\n\nFor the tokenFallback function, it has 3 arguments and the type of each argument is as follows: address, uint256, bytes.\n- For the external contract tokencontract, and the second argument is not smaller than 0x38d7ea4c68000, and initialized is not 0:\n  - it calls an external function myTokens of the external contract tokencontract.\n  - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - it calls an external function myDividends of the external contract tokencontract with 1 as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n    - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n      - When the second argument is not 0:\n        - it calls an external function transfer of the external contract tokencontract with the following argument list: ceoaddress, and ((4*the second argument)/100).\n      - When totalSupply is 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n        - When 0 is not 0, and totalSupply1 is 0:\n          - the claimedeggs of the first argument will be updated to ((0-((4*0)/100))+the claimedeggs of the first argument).\n        - When totalSupply1 is not 0, and 0 is 0:\n          - the claimedeggs of the first argument will be updated to (0+the claimedeggs of the first argument).\n      - When v0 is greater than 1:\n        - it calls an external function reinvest of the external contract tokencontract.\n\n.\n Here are some state variables with their corresponding types: public state variable `tokencontract` is typed address,public state variable `eggs_to_hatch_1shrimp` is typed uint256,public state variable `starting_shrimp` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply` is typed uint256,private state variable `totalSupply1` is typed uint256,public state variable `ceoaddress` is typed address,public state variable `initialized` is typed bool,public state variable `hatcheryshrimp` is typed mapping,public state variable `claimedeggs` is typed mapping,public state variable `lasthatch` is typed mapping,public state variable `referrals` is typed mapping,public state variable `marketeggs` is typed uint256.\n Here are some programming specifications: - You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
