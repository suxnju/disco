The `trusteeWithdraw` and `withdraw` functions are both payable and transfer ether to the specified addresses. The `trusteeWithdraw` function transfers ether to the trustee, while the `withdraw` function transfers ether to the caller. Both functions use `.call` instead of `.transfer` or `.send` to transfer ether.",
