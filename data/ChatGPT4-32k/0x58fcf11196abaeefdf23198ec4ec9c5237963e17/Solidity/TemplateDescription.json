You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",

	"prompts": "You are an experienced smart contract developer that excels at Solidity program languages. Please write a contract code by the following contract descriptions. Some state variables and programming specifications are provided to help you develop. The following is the description of the contract logic: For the payable constructor function.\n- the state variable isfinalized will be updated to 0.\n\nFor the transferOwnership function, it has one argument and its type is address.\n- For owner, and the first argument does not equal to 0:\n  - the state variable owner will be updated to the first argument.\n\nFor the claimRefund function.\n- When weiraised is smaller than goal, and isfinalized is not 0:\n  - it calls an external function refund of the external contract vault with caller as the argument.\n\nFor the finalize function.\n- For owner, and isfinalized is 0:\n  - After endtime:\n    - When weiraised is not smaller than goal:\n      - it calls an external function close of the external contract vault.\n    - the state variable isfinalized will be updated to 1.\n    - When weiraised is smaller than goal:\n      - it calls an external function enableRefunds of the external contract vault.\n  - When weiraised is not smaller than cap:\n    - When weiraised is not smaller than goal:\n      - it calls an external function close of the external contract vault.\n    - the state variable isfinalized will be updated to 1.\n    - When weiraised is smaller than goal:\n      - it calls an external function enableRefunds of the external contract vault.\n  - When (weiraised+minimuminvestment) is greater than cap:\n    - When weiraised is not smaller than goal:\n      - it calls an external function close of the external contract vault.\n    - the state variable isfinalized will be updated to 1.\n    - When weiraised is smaller than goal:\n      - it calls an external function enableRefunds of the external contract vault.\n\nFor the payable fallback function.\n- For users, except for 0:\n  - it calls an external function isWhitelisted of the external contract whitelist with caller as the argument, and gets the returned value as v0.\n  - When v0 is not 0, and the call or transfer succeeds:\n    - When (weiraised+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)) is not greater than cap, and the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) is not smaller than minimuminvestment:\n      - the state variable weiraised will be updated to (weiraised+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)).\n      - When the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) does not equal to 0:\n        - it calls an external function transferFrom of the external contract token with the following argument list: owner, caller, and (the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)*rate).\n      - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n        - When weiraised is not smaller than goal:\n          - it transfers the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) to wallet.\n          - When the balance of the external contract vault is greater than 0:\n            - it calls an external function forwardFunds of the external contract vault.\n        - When weiraised is smaller than goal:\n          - it calls an external function deposit of the external contract vault with ether valued valued the ether just received (i.e., msg.value) and caller as the argument.\n    - When (weiraised+minimuminvestment) is not greater than cap, and after starttime, and (weiraised+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value)) is greater than cap:\n      - it transfers ((weiraised+the ether just received (i.e., msg.value))-cap) to caller.\n      - When the call or transfer fails:\n        - the state variable weiraised will be updated to (weiraised+(cap-weiraised)).\n        - When (cap-weiraised) equals to 0:\n          - it calls an external function transferFrom of the external contract token with the following argument list: owner, caller, and 0.\n        - When the call or transfer succeeds:\n          - When weiraised is not smaller than goal:\n            - it transfers ether valued (cap-weiraised) to wallet.\n            - When the balance of the external contract vault is greater than 0:\n              -

You must declare a variable before you can use it, but the same variable cannot be declared twice\n- You must lock the pragma and use a stable version (e.g., pragma solidity `0.6.12`).\n- For exteranal calls, you must use `.call()` instead of `.transfer()` and `.send()`.\n- The target address who receives ether must be `payable address` type.\n- You must make the function `payable` if `msg.value` is used in the public functions.\n- From security perspectives, you must check whether an overflow or underflow is possible before an arithmetic operation (e.g., safemath operations), and you should determine whether the user's address is empty before transferring ether to the him.\n- You cannot import external resources because you are a separate contract.\n- You must use the following methods in new versions rather than old methods\n  - For some built-in functions, \n    - `abi.encodePacked(...) returns (bytes memory)` performs packed encoding of arguments to bytes.\n    - `keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.\n    - `sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32)` computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.\n    - `ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)` recovers the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. \n  - For some properties,\n    - `block.number (uint)` returns the current block number.\n    - `block.timestamp (uint)` returns the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch.\n    - `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)` returns the hash of the given block.\n- `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` means `-1`, so `+0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` indeed means `-1`.\n",
