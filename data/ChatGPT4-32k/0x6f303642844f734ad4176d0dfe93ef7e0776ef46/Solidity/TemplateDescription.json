The fallback function is used to receive ether and update the balance of the sender and `amountraised`. The `checkGoalReached` function checks if the funding goal has been reached after the deadline. The `tokenWithdraw` function allows the beneficiary to withdraw tokens after the deadline has been reached. The `safeWithdrawal` function allows for withdrawal of funds after the deadline, with checks for success of the withdrawal.",
